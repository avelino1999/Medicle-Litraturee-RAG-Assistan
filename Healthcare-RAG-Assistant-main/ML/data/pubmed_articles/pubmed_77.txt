Polypathology is a major driver of heterogeneity in the clinical presentation 
and extent of neurodegeneration (N) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Beyond amyloid (A) and tau (T) pathologies, over half of patients with AD have 
concomitant pathology such as α-synuclein (S) in mixed AD with Lewy body disease 
(LBD). Patients with multiple aetiology dementia such as AD + LBD have faster 
progression and potentially differential responses to targeted treatments, 
although the diagnosis of AD + LBD can be challenging given the overlapping 
clinical and imaging features. Development and validation of improved in vivo 
biomarkers are required to study relationships between N and S and identify 
imaging patterns reflecting mixed AD + LBD pathologies. We hypothesized that 
individual proteinopathies, such as T and S, are associated with commensurate 
levels of N. Thus, we assessed biomarkers of A, T, N and S with PET, MRI and CSF 
seeding amplification assay (SAA) data to determine molecular presentations of 
mixed A+S+ versus A+S- cognitively impaired patients from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Strikingly, A+S+ patients had 
parieto-occipital 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose hypometabolism (a measure of N) 
disproportionate to the degree of regional atrophy or T burden, highlighting 
worse hypometabolism associated with S+ status on SAA. Following up on this 
hypometabolic mismatch with CSF metabolite and proteome analyses, we found that 
A+S+ patients exhibited lower CSF levels of dopamine metabolites and synaptic 
markers like neuronal pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), suggesting that altered 
neurotransmission and neuron integrity contribute to this dissociation between 
metabolic PET and MRI. Potential confounders exist when studying relations 
between N, AD and LBD pathologies, including neuroinflammation and other 
non-Alzheimer's pathologies in mixed dementia, although our findings imply 
posterior hypometabolic mismatch is related more to S than vascular or TDP-43 
pathology. Overall, A+S+ patients had posterior mismatch with excessive 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose hypometabolism relative to atrophy or T load, possibly 
reflecting impaired neuronal integrity. Further research must disentangle the 
impact of multiple proteinopathies and clinicopathologic factors on 
hypometabolism and atrophy. Cumulatively, patients with mixed AD + LBD 
aetiologies harbour a unique metabolic PET mismatch signature.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a multifaceted and heterogeneous group of 
complex diseases. Unfortunately, a cure for these conditions has yet to be 
found, but there are ways to reduce the risk of developing them. Studies have 
shown that specific vitamins regulate the brain molecules and signaling 
pathways, which may help prevent degeneration. This review focuses on examining 
the role of vitamins in preventing five significant types of neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (ALS). This review also highlights promising and controversial 
findings about the potential impact of vitamins on this group of diseases. 
Several developed countries standardize daily dietary vitamin intake to meet 
nutrient requirements, improve health, and prevent chronic diseases like NDDs. 
However, more research is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding 
of their therapeutic benefits, including studies exploring different drug-dose 
paradigms, diverse humanized animal models, and clinical trials conducted in 
various locations.

Diet is a modifiable lifestyle factor with a proven role in cardiovascular 
disease risk reduction that might also play an important part in cognitive 
health. Evidence from observational studies has linked certain healthy dietary 
patterns to cognitive benefits. However, clinical trials of diet interventions 
have demonstrated either null or, at best, small effects on cognitive outcomes. 
In this Review, we summarize the currently available evidence from observational 
epidemiology and clinical trials regarding the potential role of diet in 
the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. We further discuss possible 
methodological limitations that might have hindered the ability of previous diet 
intervention trials to capture potential neuroprotective effects. Considering 
the overwhelming and continuously expanding societal, economic and health-care 
burden of Alzheimer disease and other dementias, future nutritional research 
must address past methodological challenges to accurately and reliably inform 
clinical practice guidelines and public health policies. Within this scope, we 
provide a roadmap for future diet intervention trials for dementia prevention. 
We discuss study designs involving both intensive personalized interventions - 
to evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, establish 
neuroprotective thresholds, and test hypothesized biological mechanisms and 
effects on brain health and cognition through sensitive and precise biomarker 
measures - and large-scale, pragmatic public health interventions to study 
population-level benefits.

Cholinergic treatments with an emphasis on M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 
(mAChR) agonists as potential modulating agents are a new approach in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. In previous research, we designed and 
characterized novel thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TZD)-derived compounds that possess 
anti-AD properties and enhance the expression of mAChRM1 in rats. This study 
evaluated a novel orthosteric agonist of mAChRM1 from related pathways that has 
shown promising anti-Alzheimer's disease activity. PC12 cells were exposed to 
various concentrations of TZ4M before they were exposed to scopolamine (3 µM). 
Immunocytochemistry and western blot analyses revealed that TZ4M increased the 
expression of mAChRM1 in differentiated cells induced by scopolamine-treated 
PC12 cells. The results showed that TZ4M (3 and 5 µM) markedly upregulated PKC 
and ChAT protein expression, and the cells were significantly protected against 
increased ROS levels followed by neuronal cell loss, as evidenced by the MTT 
assay. TUNEL staining indicated that TZ4M impeded the shaping of apoptotic 
bodies. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the ligand-protein binding site 
indicated that TZ4M is bound to the orthosteric site (acetylcholine site). This 
study revealed that TZ4M, a derivative of TZD, effectively protects against 
scopolamine-induced damage. TZ4M, a novel mACRM1 orthosteric agonist, is 
promising for treating AD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable, progressive and common movement 
disorder that is increasing in incidence globally because of population aging. 
We hypothesized that the landscape of rare, protein-altering variants could 
provide further insights into disease pathogenesis. Here we performed 
whole-exome sequencing followed by gene-based tests on 4,298 PD cases and 5,512 
controls of Asian ancestry. We showed that GBA1 and SMPD1 were significantly 
associated with PD risk, with replication in a further 5,585 PD cases and 5,642 
controls. We further refined variant classification using in vitro assays and 
showed that SMPD1 variants with reduced enzymatic activity display the strongest 
association (<44% activity, odds ratio (OR) = 2.24, P = 1.25 × 10-15) with PD 
risk. Moreover, 80.5% of SMPD1 carriers harbored the Asian-specific p.Pro332Arg 
variant (OR = 2.16; P = 4.47 × 10-8). Our findings highlight the utility of 
performing exome sequencing in diverse ancestry groups to identify rare 
protein-altering variants in genes previously unassociated with disease.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder escalating worldwide, 
remains incurable with existing interventions merely mitigating symptoms. 
Hydralazine, an antihypertensive agent, has displayed neuroprotective potential 
in AD animal models via amplification of mitochondrial functionality and 
stimulation of stress management and repair pathways. Nevertheless, its 
effectiveness and tolerability in human AD cohorts are yet to be confirmed. This 
study protocol describes the design of an ongoing, single-center, randomized, 
triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess hydralazine's effects on 
cognitive function in mild to moderate -stage AD patients. We will enroll 424 
patients aged 50 and older, meeting NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD with 
Mini-Mental State Examination scores from 12-26. They'll be randomly assigned to 
receive either hydralazine HCL (25 mg, thrice daily) or a placebo for 12 months. 
The primary outcome is the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale change from 
baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes include various measures using Lawton 
instrumental activities of daily living scale, neuropsychiatry inventory, and 
caregiver activity survey. This trial will explore the potential benefits and 
risks of hydralazine in mild to moderate AD treatment. It's the first trial 
examining hydralazine's impact on mild to moderate -stage AD in human and is 
registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200711048075N1, 
registered 29/07/2020) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 04,842,552AQ, registered 
13/04/2021). Ethics approval was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of the 
National Institute for Medical Research Development (IR.NIMAD.REC.1398.424), 
following the SPIRIT Statement guidelines. Findings will be disseminated via 
peer-reviewed publications and conferences. This inaugural human clinical trial 
evaluates hydralazine's impact on patients in the mild to moderate AD. Executed 
with a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled methodology, this study 
incorporates a significant sample size and an extended monitoring duration. 
Multiple parameters, including cognitive capabilities, will be assessed. 
Potential limitations include the inherent homogeneity of the AD cohort, the 
lack of biomarker assays, and the unpredictable progression of the disease. 
Notably, the study might not elucidate the protracted effects of hydralazine 
beyond a 12-month period. Another limitation of our clinical trial is that 
patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease based solely on clinical 
evaluation and MRI findings, without the inclusion of specific biomarkers, which 
may impact the accuracy and specificity of the diagnosis. Trial registration: 
Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20200711048075N1, registered 
29/07/2020) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 04,842,552, registered 13/04/2021).

Disorders, including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative 
diseases, can threaten human health; therefore, disease prevention is essential. 
Naringenin, a phytochemical with low toxicity, has been used in various disease 
prevention studies. This study aimed to comprehensively review the effects of 
naringenin on human health. First, we introduced the general characteristics of 
naringenin and its pharmacokinetic features when absorbed in the body. Next, we 
summarized the inhibitory effects of naringenin on colorectal, gastric, lung, 
breast, ovarian, cervical, prostate, bladder, liver, pancreatic, and skin 
cancers in preclinical studies. Lastly, we investigated the inhibitory effects 
of naringenin on metabolic disorders, including diabetes, obesity, 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiac toxicity, hypertrophy, steatosis, liver 
disease, and arteriosclerosis, as well as on neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, naringenin 
may serve as a significant natural compound that benefits human health.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, 
neuroinflammation is an early pathological feature of AD. However, the 
alteration of the immune microenvironment in asymptomatic AD was not fully 
explained. In this study, we aimed to utilize the transcriptome data of AD 
patients in public databases to reveal the change of immune microenvironment in 
asymptomatic AD and screen the potential drug targets. A series of 
bioinformatics analyses were done, including differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) screening, enrichment analysis, PPI network construction, and hub gene 
identification. Meanwhile, the selected hub genes were validated in APP/PS-1(AD) 
mice. Importantly, seven enrichment pathways and eight hub genes associated with 
inflammation were identified in asymptomatic AD. Correspondingly, more hub genes 
were increased in the hippocampus in AD mice compared to the other four brain 
regions. Accompanied by the activation of microglia and astrocytes, the 
inflammatory cytokines were increased in the hippocampus of AD mice. 
Subsequently, the relationship between HLA-C and inflammation was evaluated in 
AD mice. HLA-C was correlated with the activation of microglia, and HLA-DRB1 
with IL-6 in the hippocampus. Moreover, HLA-C is expressed in the microglia 
cells and astrocytes. Further, five FDA-approved drugs (Itrazole, Dfo, 
Syrosingopine, Cefoperazone, and Pradaxa) were predicted as the common drug 
targeting HLA-C and HLA-DRB1 by molecular docking. Taken together, the results 
revealed the changes in the immune microenvironment of asymptomatic AD and 
provided a new perspective for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs for AD 
early treatment.

BACKGROUND: Our previous animal study revealed that supplementation with milk 
fat globule membrane (MFGM) alleviated Alzheimer's disease pathology in mice. We 
hypothesized that supplementation with whey protein powder rich in MFGM, 
taurine, and B vitamins would improve cognitive function in subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVES: We conducted a 12-mo randomized controlled trial to investigate the 
effects of whey protein powder on cognitive function in older adults with MCI.
METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the active 
intervention group (whey protein powder, 15 g/d) or the control group (placebo, 
15 g/d). We performed comprehensive cognitive function tests at baseline, 6 mo, 
and 12 mo. The primary outcome was global cognitive function determined by the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary outcomes included other 
cognitive subdomains, and body composition. The data were analyzed using the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) principle.
RESULTS: A total of 107 participants [mean (standard deviation) age 62.94 (4.33) 
y] were randomly assigned to the active intervention group (n = 53), or control 
group (n = 54). In the ITT analysis, the mean change in MoCA score at 12 mo was 
3.23 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.17, 4.30] in the active intervention group 
and 1.42 (95% CI: 0.36, 2.48) in the control group, with the mean difference 
between groups (group × time interaction) in change of MoCA score was 1.81 (95% 
CI: 0.32, 3.30). The modified ITT and per-protocol analyses showed similar 
results. The results also found a significant beneficial effect of the active 
intervention for several secondary cognitive outcomes such as Digit Symbol 
Substitution Test score, and the mean difference between groups in the ITT 
analysis was 2.72 (95% CI: 0.20, 5.23). Few side effects were reported during 
the study, and there was no statistically significant difference between groups 
(P = 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with whey protein powder rich in MFGM, taurine, and 
B vitamins for 12 mo improve cognitive function in older adults with MCI. This 
trial was registered at the https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=150871 
as ChiCTR2200062705.

Huperzia serrata (HS) has been a staple of traditional Chinese medicine for 
centuries, revered for its efficacy in treating various ailments such as pain 
relief, hemostasis, detoxification, dehumidification, and heat clearing. This 
review offers an in-depth summary of the botany, traditional utilization, 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, phytochemistry, and safety profile of HS and 
intends to shed light on potential future research directions and applications 
of this plant. Information on HS was gathered from ScienceDirect, PubMed, 
Springer, Sci Finder, Baidu Scholar, and Google Scholar. Over 94 compounds have 
been separated and identified from HS, including alkaloids, terpenoids, volatile 
oils, flavonoids, and polysaccharides. Both crude extracts and purified 
compounds from HS have shown promise in treating a spectrum of conditions, 
including Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, pain, cancer, and inflammation. These 
extracts and compounds exhibit diverse pharmacological properties, including 
neuroprotective, anti-Alzheimer's, anti-epileptic, analgesic, cardioprotective, 
hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Pharmacological 
investigations support the traditional use of HS and may validate the folk 
medicinal use of HS to treat many chronic diseases. Current literature suggests 
that the bioactivity of HS is largely attributed to its alkaloids and 
polysaccharides. However, further exploration is warranted to comprehensively 
understand the structure-function relationship of these constituents, molecular 
mechanisms, and their potential synergistic and antagonistic interactions. 
Moreover, additional modern pharmacological explorations are necessary to 
validate the traditional use of HS such as promoting hemostasis, treating 
tuberculosis, hemorrhoids, and diarrhea. Therefore, there is a pressing need for 
comprehensive investigations to fully assess HS' medicinal properties and 
therapeutic potential.

The detection of patients in the cognitive normal (CN), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages of neurodegeneration is 
crucial for early treatment interventions. However, the heterogeneity of MCI 
data samples poses a challenge for CN vs. MCI vs. AD multiclass classification, 
as some samples are closer to AD while others are closer to CN in the feature 
space. Previous attempts to address this challenge produced inaccurate results, 
leading most frameworks to break the assessment into binary classification tasks 
such as AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and CN vs. MCI. Other methods proposed sequential 
binary classifications such as CN vs. others and dividing others into AD vs. 
MCI. While those approaches may have yielded encouraging results, the sequential 
binary classification method makes interpretation and comparison with other 
frameworks challenging and subjective. Those frameworks exhibited varying 
accuracy scores for different binary tasks, making it unclear how to compare the 
model performance with other direct multiclass methods. Therefore, we introduce 
a classification framework comprising unsupervised ensemble manifold regularized 
sparse low-rank approximation and regularized multikernel support vector machine 
(SVM). This framework first extracts a joint feature embedding from MRI and PET 
neuroimaging features, which were then combined with the Apoe4, Adas11, MPACC 
digits, and Intracranial volume features using a regularized multikernel SVM. 
Using that framework, we achieved a state-of-the-art (SOTA) result in a CN vs. 
MCI vs. AD multiclass classification (mean accuracy: 84.87±6.09, F1 score: 
84.83±6.12 vs 67.69). The methods generalize well to binary classification 
tasks, achieving SOTA results in all but the CN vs. MCI category, which was 
slightly lower than the best score by just 0.2%.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder and the leading 
cause of dementia. Despite significant efforts, treatment strategies targeting 
amyloid-β have been less successful than anticipated. Recently, the role of 
neuroinflammation and adaptive immune response in AD pathogenesis has gained 
attention. Here, we performed immune cell-enriched single-cell RNA sequencing of 
brain parenchymal cells from 12-month-old 5xFAD, an AD mouse model. We analyzed 
11,587 single cells and found distinct differences in T cell and choroid plexus 
cell populations between 5xFAD mouse and littermate control. Subsequent 
sub-clustering of T cells in the 5xFAD mouse revealed distinct subtypes, with 
CD8+ resident memory T cells (TRM) being the most prevalent T cell type. In 
addition, we observed an increase in T cell exhaustion markers, including Pdcd1, 
Ctla4, and Havcr2, with a particularly significant elevation of PD-1 and TIM-3 
in CD8+ TRM in 5xFAD mouse. Furthermore, choroid plexus (ChP) epithelial cells 
showed altered gene expression patterns, with higher expression of MHC class I 
and Type I IFN-stimulated genes in 5xFAD mouse compared to the control mouse, 
suggesting an association with clonal expansion of AD-specific T cells in the 
brain. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, our study 
highlights the potential role of resident memory CD8+ T cell and their possible 
interactions with ChP epithelial cells. This study provides an exploration of 
the brain microenvironment landscape in AD, revealing critical insights into its 
underlying mechanisms.

Due to the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), effective 
multi-targeted directed ligands (MTDLs) are urgently needed for its treatment as 
single-target drugs currently encounter therapeutic challenges. Two series of 
new 4-aminoquinoline derivatives containing an amine or hydroxamic acid terminal 
were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their cholinesterase inhibition, 
antioxidant and metal-ion chelation properties. Among them, hydroxamic 
acid-containing compounds 7r and 7f exhibited the best inhibitor activity 
against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), 
respectively, with the corresponding IC50 values of 0.41 and 1.06 μM, which were 
superior to those of rivastigmine (IC50 = 5.26, 2.02 μM, respectively). 
Moreover, compounds 7r and 7f presented excellent ABTS radical scavenging 
efficiency and selective metal-ion chelation ability such as Cu2+ and Fe2+. Both 
molecular docking and enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that compound 7r was a 
mixed-type inhibitor of AChE. Additionally, the ADME prediction indicated that 
compounds 7r and 7f have suitable pharmacokinetic and drug-like properties. 
Furthermore, they demonstrated good safety and blood-brain barrier permeability 
in cytotoxicity assays and in vivo experiments, respectively. These findings 
strongly suggest that the 4-aminoquinoline derivatives containing a hydroxamic 
acid terminal have great potential as promising MTDLs for the treatment of AD, 
opening new avenues for future therapeutic strategies.

    bioRxiv. 2024 Jul 16:2024.07.11.603157. doi: 10.1101/2024.07.11.603157.

While moderately activated microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are pivotal in 
clearing amyloid beta (Aβ), hyperactivated microglia perpetuate 
neuroinflammation. Prior investigations reported that the elimination of ~80% of 
microglia through inhibition of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) 
during the advanced stage of neuroinflammation in 5xFamilial AD (5xFAD) mice 
mitigates synapse loss and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, prolonged CSF1R 
inhibition diminished the development of parenchymal plaques. Nonetheless, the 
effects of short-term CSF1R inhibition during the early stages of 
neuroinflammation on residual microglia are unknown. Therefore, we investigated 
the effects of 10-day CSF1R inhibition using PLX5622 in three-month-old female 
5xFAD mice, a stage characterized by the onset of neuroinflammation and minimal 
Aβ plaques. We observed ~65% microglia depletion in the hippocampus and cerebral 
cortex. The leftover microglia displayed a noninflammatory phenotype with 
reduced NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome 
complexes. Moreover, plaque-associated microglia were reduced with diminished 
Clec7a expression. Additionally, phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein and the 
protein sequestosome 1 analysis suggested reduced mechanistic targets of 
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and autophagy in microglia and neurons within the 
hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Biochemical assays validated the inhibition of 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation, decreased mTOR signaling in the hippocampus and 
cerebral cortex, and enhanced autophagy in the hippocampus. However, short-term 
CSF1R inhibition did not influence Aβ plaques, soluble Aβ-42 levels, astrocyte 
hypertrophy, or hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, short-term CSF1R inhibition 
during the early stages of neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice promotes the 
retention of homeostatic microglia with diminished inflammasome activation and 
mTOR signaling, alongside increased autophagy.

Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and other dementias 
as well as Parkinson's disease, are emerging as profoundly significant 
challenges and burdens to global health, a trend highlighted by the most recent 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 studies. This growing impact is closely 
linked to the demographic shift toward an aging population and the potential 
long-term repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which have intensified 
the prevalence and severity of these conditions. In this review, we explore 
several critical aspects of this complex issue, including the increasing global 
burden of neurodegenerative diseases, unmet medical and social needs within 
current care systems, the unique and amplified challenges posed by the COVID-19 
pandemic, and potential strategies for enhancing healthcare policy and practice. 
We underscore the urgent need for cohesive, multidisciplinary approaches across 
medical, research, and policy domains to effectively address the increasing 
burden of neurodegenerative diseases, thereby improving the quality of life for 
patients and their caregivers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder condition linked to 
various systemic comorbidities. Numerous studies have shown bidirectional 
crosstalk between the heart and the brain, but the specifics of how these 
interactions occur in AD are poorly understood. This narrative review summarizes 
the clinical evidence for a firm link between AD and cardiovascular health and 
discusses the bidirectional roles of AD and the cardiovascular system. AD 
pathogenic proteins, AD risk genes, neurohormones, the autonomic nervous system, 
and neurotransmitters may affect cardiovascular health, and cardiac-derived 
proteins, neurohormones, vascular function, inflammation, and other potential 
specific molecules or neural pathways may also influence AD pathology and 
cognitive function. Additionally, we propose potential AD intervention 
strategies based on the heart-brain axis to provide novel insights into AD 
prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle behavior change and mindfulness have direct and 
synergistic effects on cognitive functioning and may prevent Alzheimer disease 
and Alzheimer disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). We are iteratively developing 
and testing My Healthy Brain (MHB), the first mindfulness-based lifestyle group 
program targeting AD/ADRD risk factors in older adults with subjective cognitive 
decline. Our pilot studies (National Institutes of Health [NIH] stage 1A) have 
shown that MHB is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvement in 
lifestyle behavior and cognitive outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We will compare the feasibility of MHB versus an education control 
(health enhancement program [HEP]) in 50 older adults (aged ≥60 y) with 
subjective cognitive decline and AD/ADRD risk factors. In an NIH stage 1B 
randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will evaluate feasibility benchmarks, 
improvements in cognitive and lifestyle outcomes, and engagement of hypothesized 
mechanisms.
METHODS: We are recruiting through clinics, flyers, web-based research 
platforms, and community partnerships. Participants are randomized to MHB or the 
HEP, both delivered in telehealth groups over 8 weeks. MHB participants learn 
behavior modification and mindfulness skills to achieve individualized lifestyle 
goals. HEP participants receive lifestyle education and group support. 
Assessments are repeated after the intervention and at a 6-month follow-up. Our 
primary outcomes are feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, credibility, 
satisfaction, and fidelity benchmarks. The secondary outcomes are cognitive 
function and lifestyle (physical activity, sleep, nutrition, alcohol and tobacco 
use, and mental and social activity) behaviors. Data analyses will include the 
proportion of MHB and HEP participants who meet each benchmark (primary outcome) 
and paired samples 2-tailed t tests, Cohen d effect sizes, and the minimal 
clinically important difference for each measure (secondary outcomes).
RESULTS: Recruitment began in January 2024. We received 225 inquiries. Of these 
225 individuals, 40 (17.8%) were eligible. Of the 40 eligible participants, 21 
(52.5%) were enrolled in 2 group cohorts, 17 (42.5%) were on hold for future 
group cohorts, and 2 (5%) withdrew before enrollment. All participants have 
completed before the intervention assessments. All cohort 1 participants (9/21, 
43%) have completed either MHB or the HEP (≥6 of 8 sessions) and after the 
intervention assessments. The intervention for cohort 2 (12/21, 57%) is ongoing. 
Adherence rates for the Garmin Vivosmart 5 (128/147, 87.1% weeks) and daily 
surveys (105/122, 86.1% weeks) are high. No enrolled participants have dropped 
out. Enrollment is projected to be completed by December 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: The RCT will inform the development of a larger efficacy RCT (NIH 
stage 2) of MHB versus the HEP in a more diverse sample of older adults, testing 
mechanisms of improvements through theoretically driven mediators and 
moderators. The integration of mindfulness with lifestyle behavior change in MHB 
has the potential to be an effective and sustainable approach for increasing the 
uptake of AD/ADRD risk reduction strategies among older adults.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by 
insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It is also known to be a risk factor for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating the body's 
metabolism and is responsible for activating the Phosphoinotide-3-Kinase 
(PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. This pathway is activated when 
insulin binds to the insulin receptor on nerve cells, and it helps regulate the 
metabolism of glucose and lipids. Dysfunction in the insulin signaling pathway 
can lead to a decrease in brain insulin levels and insulin sensitivity, thereby 
inducing disruptions in insulin signal transduction and leading to disorders in 
brain energy metabolism. Moreover, these dysfunctions also contribute to the 
accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau 
protein, both of which are characteristic features of AD. Therefore, this 
article focuses on insulin resistance to reveal the complex mechanism between 
brain insulin resistance and AD occurrence in T2DM. On this basis, this article 
further summarizes the biological effects and mechanisms of antidiabetic drugs 
on the two diseases, aiming to provide new ideas for the discovery of drugs for 
the treatment of T2DM combined with AD.

The gut microbiota plays a critical role in maintaining human health, 
influencing a wide range of physiological processes, including immune 
regulation, metabolism, and neurological function. Recent studies have shown 
that imbalances in gut microbiota composition can contribute to the onset and 
progression of various diseases, such as metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity and 
diabetes) and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's). 
These conditions are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and dysregulated 
immune responses, which are closely linked to specific forms of cell death, 
including pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Pathogenic bacteria in the gut can trigger 
these cell death pathways through toxin release, while probiotics have been 
found to mitigate these effects by modulating immune responses. Despite these 
insights, the precise mechanisms through which the gut microbiota influences 
these diseases remain insufficiently understood. This review consolidates recent 
findings on the impact of gut microbiota in these immune-mediated and 
inflammation-associated conditions. It also identifies gaps in current research 
and explores the potential of advanced technologies, such as organ-on-chip 
models and the microbiome-gut-organ axis, for deepening our understanding. 
Emerging tools, including single-bacterium omics and spatial metabolomics, are 
discussed for their promise in elucidating the microbiota's role in disease 
development.

BACKGROUND: Gastrodiae rhizoma (GR) refers to the dried tuber of Gastrodia elata 
Bl. and has been used for many centuries to treat brain diseases, such as 
Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, and cerebral ischemia. However, 
the processing of GR is complex and varied, resulting in unstable clinical 
treatment effects. The processing protocols significantly affect the active 
ingredients and curative effects of GR. We can optimize the processing of GR by 
identifying quality markers to treat brain diseases.
METHODS: Fresh tubers of G. elata Bl. were processed under eight different 
protocols, and their resulting contents of potentially bioactive compounds were 
compared using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to screen the potential 
quality markers of GR through stoichiometric analysis. The potential quality 
markers of GR targeting Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, and 
cerebral ischemia were identified by network pharmacology, and the potentially 
neuroprotective effects of these components were validated through simulated 
docking to likely protein targets. Finally, a fit degree analysis was carried 
out using different composition ratios and proportions of the disease component 
degree value, and the therapeutic effects of different processing methods on 
Alzheimer's disease, major depressive disorder, and cerebral ischemia were 
outlined clearly.
RESULTS: We identified 32 potential therapeutic components and screened 13 
quality markers in GR, of which five quality markers (galactinol, glucosyringic 
acid, parishins C and E, and S-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-glutathione) showed efficacy 
against all three brain diseases. Furthermore, steaming and microwave-drying 
during processing can optimize the components of these quality markers for 
treating the three diseases.
CONCLUSION: Processing protocols significantly affect the therapeutic components 
of GR and may also impact its effectiveness in treating brain diseases. 
Accordingly, optimizing the processing methods of GR to correspond to different 
therapeutic purposes may improve its efficacy against brain diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, 
characterized by the accumulation of Aβ and abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation. 
Despite substantial efforts in development of drugs targeting Aβ and tau 
pathologies, effective therapeutic strategies for AD remain elusive. Recent 
attention has been paid to the significant role of cellular senescence in AD 
progression. Mounting evidence suggests that interventions targeting cellular 
senescence hold promise in improving cognitive function and ameliorating 
hallmark pathologies in AD. This narrative review provides a comprehensive 
summary and discussion of the physiological roles, characteristics, biomarkers, 
and commonly employed in vivo and in vitro models of cellular senescence, with a 
particular focus on various cell types in the brain, including astrocytes, 
microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, neurons, and endothelial cells. The 
review further delves into factors influencing cellular senescence in AD and 
emphasizes the significance of targeting cellular senescence as a promising 
approach for AD treatment, which includes the utilization of senolytics and 
senomorphics.

BACKGROUND: We systematically reviewed Mendelian randomization (MR) studies and 
summarized evidence on the potential effects of different antihypertensive drugs 
on health.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for MR studies evaluating the effects of 
antihypertensive drug classes on health outcomes until 22 May 2024. We extracted 
data on study characteristics and findings, assessed study quality, and compared 
the evidence with that from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
RESULTS: We identified 2643 studies in the search, of which 37 studies were 
included. These studies explored a wide range of health outcomes including 
cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors, psychiatric and 
neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, immune function and infection, and other 
outcomes. There is strong evidence supporting the protective effects of 
genetically proxied antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular diseases. We found 
strong protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on 
diabetes whereas beta-blockers showed adverse effects. ACE inhibitors might 
increase the risk of psoriasis, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease but did 
not affect COVID-19. There is strong evidence that ACE inhibitors and calcium 
channel blockers (CCBs) are beneficial for kidney and immune function, and CCBs 
showed a safe profile for disorders of pregnancy. Most studies have high 
quality. RCT evidence supports the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and CCBs 
on stroke, diabetes, and kidney function. However, there is a lack of reliable 
RCTs to confirm the associations with other diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of the benefits and off-target effects of antihypertensive 
drugs contribute to clinical decision-making, pharmacovigilance, and the 
identification of drug repurposing opportunities.

To analyse the effectiveness of resistance training on secondary sarcopenia, we 
conducted a meta-analysis to elucidate the effects of resistance training (RT) 
on muscle strength (handgrip strength [HGS]), muscle mass (Skeletal muscle mass 
index [SMI]), and physical function (Gait speed [GS]) in patients with secondary 
sarcopenia. All studies published between 2015 and January 2024 on the effects 
of resistance training on patients with secondary sarcopenia were retrieved from 
6 electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, the 
Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Core 
journals and the Wanfang Database. Two researchers independently extracted and 
evaluated studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 12 
randomized controlled trials were included. Pooled analyses of baseline data and 
results were performed using Review Manager 5.3 with standardized mean variance 
(SMD) and random effects model. The study included 12 randomized controlled 
trials involving 639 patients (mean age 57.28 ± 2.66 to 79.6 ± 5.4 years). There 
are five types of complications among the patients: obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
Alzheimer's disease, hemodiaysis, and pancreatic cancer. Compared with the 
control group, RT effectively improved HGS [SMD = 2.47, 95% CI (1.50, 3.43), 
p < 0.01, I2 = 94%]; SMI [SMD = 0.94, 95% CI (0.52, 1.36), p < 0.01, I2 = 56%]; 
and GS [SMD = 2.18, 95% CI (-0.01, 4.37), p ≥ 0.05, I2 = 97%]. Further subgroup 
analysis of the results showed that the intervention effect on grip strength was 
greater for non-elastic band resistance [SMD = 2.40, 95% CI (1.05, 3.75), 
p < 0.01, I2 = 94%] than for elastic band resistance (EBRT) [SMD = 1.22, 95% CI 
(-0.14, 2.58), p < 0.01, I2 = 95%]. The intervention effect of RT on grip 
strength is more significant in patients with T2D [SMD = 0.59, 95%CI (0.26-0.93, 
p < 0.01, I2 = 27%] and obesity [SMD = 0.74, 95%CI (0.32-1.15, p < 0.01, 
I2 = 0%]. For patients with secondary sarcopenia, Resistance training (RT) can 
effectively enhance muscle strength and muscle mass; however, it does not 
significantly improve physical function. Different RT intervention methods have 
different effects on patients, such as elastic band training and non-elastic 
band training (bounce ball RT; equipment RT, etc.). Different types of 
complications may influence the effectiveness of RT intervention.

Copper (Cu), an indispensable micronutrient for the sustenance of living 
organisms, contributes significantly to a vast array of fundamental metabolic 
processes. The human body maintains a relatively low concentration of copper, 
which is mostly found in the bones, liver, and brain. Despite its low 
concentration, Cu plays a crucial role as an indispensable element in the 
progression and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Extensive 
studies have been conducted in recent years on copper homeostasis and 
copper-induced cell death in CNS disorders, including glioma, Alzheimer's 
disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and stroke. 
Cuproptosis, a novel copper-induced cell death pathway distinct from apoptosis, 
necrosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, has been identified as potentially 
intricately linked to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying various CNS diseases. 
Therefore, a systematic review of copper homeostasis and cuproptosis and their 
relationship with CNS disorders could deepen our understanding of the 
pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition, it may provide new insights and 
strategies for the treatment of CNS disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common 
cause of dementia, contributing to around 60-80% of cases. The main 
pathophysiology of AD is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of protein 
aggregates extracellularly (beta-amyloid plaques) and intracellularly 
(neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau). However, an increasing 
number of studies have also suggested neuroinflammation may have a crucial role 
in precipitating the cascade reactions that result in the development of AD 
neuropathology. In particular, several studies indicate microRNAs (miRNAs) can 
act as regulatory factors for neuroinflammation in AD, with potential to affect 
the occurrence and/or progression of AD inflammation by targeting the expression 
of multiple genes. Therefore, miRNAs may have potential as therapeutic targets 
for AD, which requires more research. This article will review the existing 
studies on miRNAs that have been identified to regulate neuroinflammation, 
aiming to gain further insights into the specific regulatory processes of 
miRNAs, highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of miRNAs as 
biomarkers in AD, as well as current challenges, and suggest the further work to 
bridge the gap in knowledge to utilize miRNAs as therapeutic targets for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a 
neurodegenerative disease with insidious onset and gradually worsening course. 
The brain is particularly sensitive to senescence, and neuronal senescence is an 
important risk factor for the occurrence of AD. However, the exact pathogenesis 
between neuronal senescence and AD has not been fully elucidated so far. 
Neuronal senescence is characterized by the permanent stagnation of the cell 
cycle, and the changes in its structure, function, and microenvironment are 
closely related to the pathogenesis and progression of AD. In recent years, 
studies such as the Aβ cascade hypothesis and Tau protein phosphorylation have 
provided new strategies for the therapy of AD, but due to the complexity of the 
etiology of AD, there are still no effective treatment measures. This article 
aims to deeply analyze the pathogenesis between AD and neuronal senescence, and 
sort out various existing therapeutic methods, to provide new ideas and 
references for the clinical treatment of AD.

Older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in addition to significant cognitive 
disability, have twice the risk of fracture compared to those with normal 
cognition. Fractures among older adults with AD are associated with substantial 
morbidity, loss of physical function, and significant mortality. Prior studies 
have shown a decreased risk of fracture among those taking acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors, such as donepezil. With both cognitive and non-cognitive benefits, 
donepezil would be a valuable component in a fracture prevention program for 
older adults with AD. Though anti-amyloid therapies are now clinically 
available, donepezil may still have non-cognitive benefits. However, the 
specific effects of donepezil on bone metabolism are unknown. We have designed 
this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate 
the effect of AD treatment with donepezil on bone metabolism. The study will 
measure the change in bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, and bone 
quality related to 12-months of donepezil therapy. This will be the first known 
study of changes in bone metabolism among older adults with AD.

The vagus nerve is a crucial component of the parasympathetic nervous system, 
facilitating communication between the brain and various organs, including the 
ears, heart, lungs, pancreas, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. The caudal 
nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem is the initial site regulated by 
the vagus nerve in brain-body communication, including the interactions with 
immune system. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut-brain axis, via the 
vagus nerve, may play a role in the development and progression of psychiatric, 
neurologic, and inflammation-related disorders. Population-based cohort studies 
indicate that truncal vagotomy may reduce the risk of neurological disorders 
such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, underscoring the vagus 
nerve's significance in these conditions. Given its role in the cholinergic 
anti-inflammatory pathway, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors present a 
potential therapeutic target. Additionally, noninvasive transcutaneous auricular 
vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) shows promise as a therapeutic tool for these 
disorders. This article provides a historical review of the vagus nerve and 
explores its role in brain-body communication. Finally, we discuss future 
directions, including the potential of noninvasive taVNS as a therapeutic 
approach.

In this study, we reassessed the suitability of a commonly used pharmacological 
animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) - scopolamine-induced memory 
impairment. The goal of the study was to explore if this animal model induces 
other behavioral changes associated with AD. One of the key behavioral features 
of AD, manifesting already during the early stages of the illness, is 
apathy-like behavior. We also evaluated how behavioral alterations induced by 
scopolamine compare to those seen in healthy aging animals. To achieve these 
goals, locomotor activity and short-term memory of young male Wistar rats were 
tested in the open field, novel object recognition (NOR) and T-maze spontaneous 
alternation tests before, during and after 21 daily administrations of 
scopolamine. Three-, ten- and nineteen-month-old male and female rats were used 
to measure age-related changes in these behaviors. Our data showed that although 
both scopolamine treatment and aging reduced the number of approaches to the 
objects and their exploration time during the NOR test, correlation with 
impaired object recognition memory was only observed in the scopolamine treated 
animals. Furthermore, treatment with scopolamine significantly increased the 
locomotor activity, which could be observed even one week after treatment 
discontinuation. Contrary, locomotor activity in older rats was significantly 
lower than that of younger rats. These findings demonstrate that the animal 
model of scopolamine-induced memory impairment fails to incorporate apathy-like 
symptoms characteristic to the AD and age-related reduction in physical activity 
of older rats.

Dysfunctional intraneuronal organelles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) propel 
aberrant calcium handling, triggering molecular miscommunication within 
organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. This 
disruption in organelle function not only impairs cellular homeostasis but also 
exacerbates neurodegenerative processes involving the accumulation of amyloid-β 
(Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau, amplifying the disease's vicious cycle. In 
this review, the concept of Mutual Orchestrated Inter-organelle Communication 
(MOIC) proposes potential therapeutic avenues for restoring Ca2+ homeostasis in 
AD, offering a theoretical framework for developing disease-modifying 
treatments. The intricate nature of AD necessitates a shift towards combination 
therapies targeting MOIC-associated pathways, presenting a more effective 
approach than monotherapy.

AIMS: To investigate the effects of Nrf2 agonist tertiary butylhydroquinone 
(TBHQ)-stimulated neural stem cells (NSCs) transplantation (NSC(TBHQ)) on 
neuronal damage and cognitive deficits in an AD model and its underlying 
principles.
METHODS: BHQ-treated NSCs were examined with or without Aβ1-42 to investigate 
the effects of TBHQ on the proliferation and differentiation functions. The 
mitophagy inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CSA) was used to explore the regulation of 
mitophagy by TBHQ. The no-, ethanol-, and TBHQ-treated NSCs were transplanted 
into the bilateral hippocampal region of model mice to explore the effects of 
NSC(TBHQ) on neuronal, cognitive, and mitochondrial functional impairments in 
mice.
RESULTS: TBHQ reversed the Aβ1-42-caused inhibition on NSC proliferation and 
differentiation, as well as on levels of mitochondrial membrane potential, 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and mitochondrial fusion-associated proteins. TBHQ 
alleviated the Aβ1-42-induced increase in apoptosis, mitochondrial damage, 
mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and mitochondrial 
fission-related proteins. TBHQ activated the Parkin, Beclin, LC3II/I, and COXIV 
expression, while inhibiting the p62 expression. CSA reversed the effects of 
TBHQ on NSC proliferation and differentiation. After NSC(TBHQ) transplantation, 
it not only further extended the dwell time in the target quadrant and shorten 
the time and distance for finding the hidden platform, but also further 
decreased the Aβ and p-Tau/Tau levels, while increasing the expression of NeuN. 
The effects of NSC(TBHQ) transplantation on mitochondrial function were 
consistent with the in vitro experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that NSC(TBHQ) intensifies the beneficial impact of 
NSCs transplantation on cognitive impairment and neuronal damage in AD models, 
likely due to TBHQ's role in promoting NSCs growth and differentiation via 
mitophagy, thus laying a theoretical foundation for improving NSCs 
transplantation for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques from Aβ 
deposits, neuronal inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired neuronal 
transmission involving acetylcholine and glutamate. Diabetes patients are at a 
higher risk of developing AD-like pathology due to shared pathological and 
molecular mechanisms, including insulin resistance, oxidative stress, formation 
of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and overactive immune systems. 
Current treatments of AD typically address only one aspect of the disease, 
rather than treating it as a multifactorial process. Targeting cerebral 
glucose-insulin metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy for AD 
management. Numerous studies show positive correlations between anti-diabetic 
drugs and AD management. Among these, DPP IV inhibitors have demonstrated 
significant therapeutic benefits against AD in experimental settings. DPP IV 
inhibitors have been shown to significantly reduce Aβ oligomerization, 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau), oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers, 
presenting a potentially effective approach for targeting AD-like pathology. 
Although preclinical data are promising, clinical trials are needed to validate 
these findings and establish the safety and efficacy of DPP IV inhibitors as a 
therapeutic intervention for AD. This could represent a novel approach for 
addressing both the metabolic and neurodegenerative aspects of AD.

OBJECTIVES: Exposure to aluminum (Al) has been shown to be strongly associated 
with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates 
that the toxicity of Al nanoparticle (Al-NP) is far greater than Al itself due 
to its particle size. Epidemiological studies suggest that curcumin lower the 
prevalence of AD. MAPKs (ERK, p38 and JNK) were suggested to be involved in AD 
pathology and memory impairment. The present study aimed to evaluate if curcumin 
has the ability to protect against behavioral deficits induced by subcutaneously 
administered Al-NP in mice. Furthermore, the levels of phosphorylated and total 
hippocampal MAPKs were assessed using western blottechnique.
METHODS: Al-NP (10 mg/kg/s.c.) was administered to adult male NMRI mice for 10 
days with or without curcumin in doses of 2.5 or 25 mg/kg/oral gavage). Memory 
was assessed using passive avoidance apparatus and anxiety-like behavior was 
evaluated using elevated plus maze. Following the behavioral tasks, western blot 
analysis was performed on the hippocampal tissues to detect the levels of 
phosphorylated and total MAPKs.
RESULTS: The results revealed that Al-NP deteriorated memory with no significant 
effect on anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, it activated hippocampal p38 
signaling pathway with no effect on ERK and JNK. Curcumin treatment at the dose 
of 25 mg/kg restored memory and p38 activation.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that subcutaneous Al-NP administration impairs 
memory and hippocampal p38 signaling with no effect on ERK and JNK. 
Co-administration of curcumin restored Al-NP induced memory impairment and 
hippocampal p38 phosphorylation.

BACKGROUND: Characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, 
and aberrant neuroinflammation in the brain, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 
most common neurodegenerative disease. Microglial polarization is a subtle 
mechanism which maintains immunological homeostasis and has emerged as a 
putative therapeutic to combat AD. Berberine (BBR) is a natural alkaloid 
compound with multiple pharmacological effects, and has shown considerable 
therapeutic potential against inflammatory disorders. However, BBR functions and 
underlying mechanisms in neuroinflammation remain unclear.
PURPOSE: To examine BBR pharmacological effects and mechanisms in 
neuroinflammation with a view to treating AD.
METHODS: BBR effects on cognitive performance in 5 × FAD mice were assessed 
using open field, Y-maze, and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests. 
Neuroinflammation-related markers and Aβ pathology were examined in brain 
sections from mice. Transcriptomic analyses of hippocampus tissues were also 
conducted. Microglial BV2 cells were also used to verify potential BBR 
mechanisms in neuroinflammation and microglial polarization.
RESULTS: BBR improved cognitive performance, reduced amyloid pathology, and 
alleviated aberrant neuroinflammation in an AD mouse model. BBR induced 
microglial polarization to an M2-like phenotype, which was manifested by lowered 
and elevated proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, 
respectively, improved microglial uptake and Aβ clearance. Mechanistically, BBR 
directly interacted with TYROBP and promoted its activation by stabilizing 
TYROBP oligomerization. TYROBP knockdown aggravated M1-like polarization and 
pro-inflammatory gene expression in microglial cells in the presence of 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+Aβ, while blocked microglial M2-like polarization 
benefited from BBR administration.
CONCLUSIONS: BBR modulated neuroinflammation by regulating microglial 
polarization via TYROBP activation. Our study provided new insight into BBR 
pharmacological actions in regulating microglial homeostasis and combating AD.

The brain is a highly plastic organ that continually receives and integrates 
signals to generate functional and structural changes and homeostatic 
adaptations throughout life. Alterations in some signaling pathways that mediate 
these responses can impact brain plasticity, accelerate brain aging and 
potentially lead to neurodegeneration. There is substantial evidence that two 
important signaling pathways activated by neurotrophins, nonacronymic (VGF) and 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are involved in substantial functions 
stimulating neuronal growth, differentiation, and circuit establishment during 
development and neuronal maintenance and plasticity in the mature brain. In this 
review, we present evidence that these two pathways and their interactions are 
central players in cognitive performance and alterations in pathological aging, 
particularly in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Finally, we suggest 
specific avenues for future research on the basis of recent findings suggesting 
these molecules are diagnostic biomarkers and putative therapeutic tools to 
prevent, delay or improve AD neuropathology.

Progranulin (PGRN) deficiency is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. 
Proper PGRN levels are critical for brain health; however, the function of PGRN 
is unclear. PGRN is composed of 7.5 repeat domains, called granulins, and 
processed into granulins inside the lysosome. PGRN is beneficial for neuronal 
health, but the role of individual granulins is controversial and unclear. We 
find that the expression of single granulins broadly rescues disease pathology 
in Grn-/- mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of human 
granulin-2/F, granulin-4/A, or PGRN in Grn-/- mouse brain ameliorates 
dysregulated lysosomal proteins and lipids, microgliosis, and lipofuscinosis. 
Mechanistically, granulins localize to lysosomes in Grn-/- mouse brains or 
fibroblasts. These data support the hypothesis that PGRN is a precursor to 
granulins, which share a beneficial function inside the lysosome to maintain 
lipid and protein homeostasis to prevent neurodegeneration. Thus, granulins are 
potential therapeutics to treat FTD-GRN and related diseases.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate changes in intranetwork 
functional connectivity (FC) and internetwork FC in middle-aged and elderly 
individuals with normal cognition (NC) and varying degrees of periodontitis to 
determine the effects of periodontitis on brain function.
METHODS: Periodontal findings and resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging data were acquired from 51 subjects with NC. Independent component 
analysis and correlation analysis were used for the statistical analysis of the 
data.
RESULTS: Differences in intranetwork FC were observed among groups in the 
anterior default-mode network (aDMN), dorsal attention network and dorsal 
sensorimotor network (dSMN). Compared with the nonperiodontitis (NP) group or 
the mild-periodontitis group, the analysis of internetwork FC showed increased 
FC between the auditory network and the ventral attention network (VAN), between 
the aDMN and the salience network (SN), and between the SN and the VAN and 
decreased FC between the posterior default-mode network and the right 
frontoparietal network in the moderate-to-severe periodontitis group. 
Additionally, internetwork FC between the dSMN and the VAN was also increased in 
the moderate-to-severe periodontitis group compared to the NP group. The altered 
intra- and internetwork FC were significantly correlated with the periodontal 
clinical index.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that periodontitis was associated with both 
intra- and internetwork FC changes even in NC. The present study indicates that 
periodontitis might be a potential risk factor for brain damage and provides a 
theoretical clue and a new treatment target for the early prevention of 
Alzheimer disease.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Recent research has proposed that periodontitis is a 
potential risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the relationship 
between periodontitis and the brain function of middle-aged and elderly 
individuals with normal cognition (NC) remains unclear. Analyzing the effect of 
periodontitis on brain function in the NC stage can provide clues to AD 
development and help achieve early prevention of dementia. The present study 
aimed to investigate changes in brain functional connectivity (FC) in NC with 
different severity of periodontitis to determine the effects of periodontitis on 
brain function. Both changed intranetwork FC and internetwork FC were found in 
the moderate-to-severe periodontitis group, and periodontitis was associated 
with brain network function impairment in NC. The present study indicates that 
periodontitis might be a potential risk factor for brain damage even in NC 
stage, and provides a theoretical clue and a new treatment target for the early 
prevention of AD.

Disease-specific oligomers Tau assay system is anticipated in Alzheimer disease 
(AD) to elucidate their etiological roles. We developed a highly sensitive and 
selective ELISA for high-molecular-weight oligomer tau (HMWoTau) with LLOQ of 
0.3 pg/well for the first time, using a novel mouse monoclonal antibody 
APNmAb005. The target molecule was identified as HMWoTau with circa 2000 kD as a 
minimum size and the more oligomerized species (>5000 kD), in combination 
analysis with Size-Exclusion-Chromatography and 
Sucrose-Density-Gradient-Centrifugation for both recombinant human (rh) 
Tau-derived aggregates and AD brain-lysates in PBS(-). HMWoTau was labeled by 
Thioflavin S and visualized as a homogeneous globular particle (about 30 nm in 
diameter) by two different technologies of atomic force microscopy and 
dSTORM-Nanoimager. Specific quantitation was also confirmed by 
immune-absorption, rhHMWoTau-spiked, and cross-reactivity studies. APNmAb005 
failed to detect the HMWoTau signal by treatment with DTT/SDS under no influence 
on the pan-tau antibody, indicating its conformation-specific recognition. 
APNmAb005-ELISA showed AD-specific and statistically significant ELISA signals 
from 1 ng brain lysate protein/well. Analysis of the frontal neocortex (N = 40, 
Braak stage I-VI) by ELISA revealed the detection-limit levels of HMWoTau 
species at stage I-III, and drastic and statistically significant increases at 
stage V/VI (AD). By contrast, total Tau and p181 Tau showed 1/4-1/5 levels of AD 
even at Stage I, while both tau species also showed a statistically significant 
increase in AD. In sum, our novel APNmAb005-ELISA clarified the disease-specific 
increase in HMWoTau species and will be useful for not only further etiological 
elucidation but also the potential diagnostics in AD and relevant tauopathy.

The central nervous system (CNS) involves a complex interplay of communications 
between the neurons and various glial cells, which is crucial for brain 
functions. The major interactomes are exosomes that transmit sundry molecules 
(DNA, miRNAs, and proteins) between the cells and thus alter cell physiology. 
Exosomes can act as neuroprotective or neurodegenerative agents depending on the 
microenvironment of cells secreting them. Therefore, revealing exosome proteome 
becomes important to understand donor cells' physiology and its effect on the 
recipient cell. In this study, oxidative stress was induced by Aβ25-35 in the 
human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and the protective effects of phytochemical 
ferulic acid (FA) were evaluated alone and in combination with Aβ25-35 
(pre-treated for 3 h before Aβ25-35 exposure) and proteome of their secreted 
exosomes was analyzed, which was carried out via a high-resolution LC-MS 
Triple-ToF and further network-based analysis has been carried out using various 
bioinformatics tools. The proteomic profiling enlightened the multiple roles of 
exosomes as proteins associated with the various pathways advocate that exosomes 
can mediate a wide range of effects, from normal physiological processes like 
synaptic plasticity, neuronal metabolic support, nerve regeneration, DNA repair, 
axon guidance, and long-term potentiation (LTP) to abnormal pathological 
processes like inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and 
formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). On comparison, treatment 
with Aβ25-35 resulted in a significant modulation of the exosomal proteome, 
promoting pathways associated with neurodegeneration. Conversely, the 
phytochemical FA displayed a protective effect by effectively countering 
Aβ25-35-induced oxidative stress responses linked with neurodegeneration, as 
seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Taken together, this study highlights the dual 
role of exosomes in physiological and pathophysiological neurodegenerative AD, 
which intricately depend on the particular cellular milieu.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes 
gradual memory loss and cognitive impairment. Intracerebroventricular injections 
of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) have been used as an experimental model of sporadic 
Alzheimer's disease (SAD) because they produce deficits in brain insulin 
signaling, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, resulting 
in cognitive decline and memory impairment. Spirulina platensis (SPI) is a 
nutraceutical with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective 
properties. The objective of this work was to study the effects of SPI on 
cognitive deficits and neuronal damage in mice submitted to the experimental 
model of SAD induced by ICV-STZ. Male Swiss mice (25-35 g) received ICV-STZ 
(3 mg/Kg) bilaterally on days 1 and 3, SPI (50 and 100 mg/Kg, o.p.) or vehicle 
(saline) was administered 2 h after the second surgery, and once a day for 16 
days. SPI treatment prevented working, episodic, spatial, and aversive memory 
deficits. Locomotor activity was not altered. ICV-STZ caused an increase in MDA, 
nitrite, and superoxide anion, while decreasing GSH. SPI treatment protected 
against GSH increase in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and inhibited 
AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex. SPI prevented astrogliosis and 
microgliosis induced by ICV-STZ. These findings highlight the therapeutic 
potential of SPI for the treatment of SAD, indicating that its neuroprotective 
action is linked to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and AChE inhibitory 
activity.

Amyloid-PET quantification through the tracer-independent Centiloid (CL) scale 
has emerged as an essential tool for the accurate measurement of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The AMYPAD consortium set out to 
integrate existing literature and recent work from the consortium to provide 
clinical context-of-use recommendations for the CL scale. Compared to 
histopathology, visual reads, and cerebrospinal fluid, CL quantification 
accurately reflects the amount of AD pathology. With high certainty, a CL value 
below 10 excludes the presence of Aβ pathology, while a value above 30 
corresponds well with pathological amounts. Values falling in between these two 
cutoffs ("intermediate range") are related to an increased risk of disease 
progression. Together, CL quantification is a valuable adjunct to visual 
assessments of amyloid-PET images. An abnormal amyloid biomarker assessment is a 
key criterion to determine eligibility for anti-amyloid disease-modifying 
therapies, and amyloid-PET quantification can add further value by precisely 
monitoring amyloid clearance, and hence guiding patient management decisions. 
HIGHLIGHTS: Centiloid (CL) quantification robustly reflects of the amount of Aβ 
pathology. CL < 10/CL > 30 reflects Aβ-negativity/positivity thresholds with 
high certainty. CL quantification is a valuable adjunct to visual assessments of 
amyloid-PET. CL quantification can support trial design and treatment 
management. CL quantification could support the identification of early or 
emerging Aβ pathology.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disease with limited treatment options. This study aimed to investigate the 
effects of Lycium barbarum extract (LBE), a Chinese herb, on the central nervous 
system (CNS)-including the retina, brain, and spinal cord-in 5xFAD transgenic 
mice after the onset of AD.
METHODS: Starting at 6 months of age, 5xFAD mice received daily intragastric 
gavage of LBE (2 g/kg) for 2 months. At 8 months, behavioral tests were 
conducted to assess cognition, motor function, and visual function. These 
included the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and Y-maze tests for 
cognition; the beam walking balance and clasping tests for motor function; and 
electroretinogram (ERG) for visual function. Immunohistochemistry, western 
blotting, and ELISA were used to evaluate Aβ deposition, microglial morphology, 
neuroinflammation, and neuroprotective signaling pathways. Primary microglia and 
the IMG cell line were used to study LBE's effects on Aβ uptake and degradation 
in vitro.
RESULTS: After 2 months of LBE treatment, the decline in cognition, motor, and 
visual functions in 5xFAD mice was significantly slowed. Microglia in the brain, 
spinal cord, and retina exhibited a neuroprotective state, with reduced Aβ 
deposition, decreased inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), 
increased Arg-1/iNOS ratio, and enhanced phagocytic capacity. LBE also promoted 
Aβ uptake and degradation in primary microglia and the IMG cell line. 
Neuroprotective signals such as p-Akt, p-Erk1/2, and p-CREB were elevated. 
Additionally, LBE treatment restored synaptic protein expression and enhanced 
neuroplasticity.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that LBE treatment can enhance neuroplasticity, 
reduce systemic inflammation, and improve phagocyte clearance of Aβ deposition 
via inducing a neuroprotective microglial phenotype throughout CNS. As an 
upper-class Chinese medicine, appropriate intake of LBE may serve as a 
beneficial antiaging strategy for AD.

Disease-associated microglia (DAM) are a subset of microglia that appear at 
various stages of central nervous system neurodegenerative diseases. DAM were 
identified using single-cell RNA sequencing within Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
where they were characterized by their unique localization near amyloid-β 
plaques and their phagocytic and lipid-metabolizing features. Unfortunately, 
activation and etiology of DAM are only understood within the context of AD 
where Triggering Receptor Expressed On Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2), a receptor for 
amyloid-β, appears to be the key regulator in microglial transition to a DAM 
state. Despite this reliance on TREM2 in AD, DAM appear across other 
neurodegenerative diseases in which TREM2 may not be a critical player. This 
begs the question of if DAM are truly the same across all neurodegenerative 
diseases or if there exists a heterogeneity to DAM across neurodegenerative 
pathologies. Investigation into this critical gap in the field regarding DAM 
etiology and activation, as well as DAM function, could be delineated utilizing 
models of Parkinson's disease (PD) to complement studies in models of AD. Though 
highly underexplored regarding DAM, PD with its pattern of protein 
aggregation-associated pathology like AD could serve as the spatiotemporal 
comparison against AD findings to ascertain the nature of DAM. The experimental 
vehicle that could guide the future of such investigation is the multi-omics 
model. With a compound approach focusing on exploring triggers for DAM at the 
chromatin or mRNA level and related protein output, it becomes possible to 
strongly characterize and firmly answer the question of what is a DAM.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, 
affecting 70% of patients with dementia. In Japan, over 5 million people aged 
65 years and older had dementia in 2018, and this figure is expected to rise to 
25% to 30% of this age group by 2045. In Japan, lecanemab, which was approved in 
2023, is expected to be a new treatment for AD. However, lecanemab requires 
stringent management, including amyloid PET scans and MRI monitoring, 
necessitating specialized facilities, creating concerns regarding the lack of 
treatment facilities and poor treatment access.
METHODS: This study assessed spatial accessibility to lecanemab in Hokkaido, 
Japan, using geographic information system data. Hospitals were categorized into 
3 scenarios based on their capacity to meet the treatment criteria. Service area 
analysis in each scenario evaluated the population coverage within 30-, 60-, and 
120-minute travel times. The inverted two-step floating catchment area method 
was used to calculate the potential high-demand areas index (PHDI) for each 
hospital.
RESULTS: Population coverage ranged from 56% to 97%, depending on the scenario 
and travel time. Coverage for the most feasible scenario (Scenario 1) was 56%, 
73.9%, and 88.3% within 30, 60, and 120 minutes, respectively. Northern and 
southern Hokkaido had the lowest coverage. PHDI analysis identified high-demand 
areas, with Sapporo facing potential overcapacity issues.
CONCLUSION: Lecanemab highlights the need for strategic resource allocation to 
enhance accessibility and capacity. Establishing additional treatment centers, 
particularly in areas with poor accessibility and capacity, is crucial to 
maximize the benefits of treatment for dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, is 
characterized by irreversible brain tissue degeneration. The amyloid-β (Aβ) 
cascade hypothesis stands as the predominant paradigm explaining AD 
pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Aβ-induced 
pyroptosis in AD. AD models were established using amyloid precursor 
protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice and Aβ-treated BV-2 cells (5 µM, 
24 h). NEK7 expression was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell pyroptosis was 
assessed before and after NEK7 expression was inhibited in BV-2 cells. 
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors carrying short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against 
NEK7 (AAV-sh-NEK7) were administered to mice to knockdown NEK7 in vivo. Spatial 
learning and memory abilities were evaluated using the Morris water maze test. 
The interaction between NEK7 and histone H4 lysine 12 lactylation (H4K12la) were 
then investigated. The results suggested that NEK7 expression was markedly 
elevated in both in vitro and in vivo AD models. Treatment with Aβ significantly 
reduced cell viability and enhanced pyroptosis in BV-2 cells; these effects were 
reversed by inhibiting NEK7. Furthermore, AD mice with NEK7 knockdown exhibited 
shorter escape latencies and increased time spent in the target quadrant, 
suggesting that NEK7 inhibition improved cognitive function and memory 
retention. Mechanistically, Aβ treatment induced histone lactylation in BV-2 
cells, and suppression of lactylation attenuated NEK7 transcriptional activity 
and mRNA levels. In summary, elevated NEK7 expression promoted histone 
lactylation in BV-2 cells, thereby facilitating pyroptosis. Inhibition of NEK7 
conferred protection against Aβ-induced cellular damage and enhanced cognitive 
performance and memory retention in AD model mice. Collectively, targeting NEK7 
represents a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating AD symptoms.

Disturbances in the fatty acid lipidome are increasingly recognized as key 
drivers in the progression of various brain disorders. In this review article, 
we delve into the impact of Δ9 fatty acid desaturases, with a particular focus 
on stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), within the setting of neuroinflammation, 
neurodegeneration, and brain repair. Over the past years, it was established 
that inhibition or deficiency of SCD1 not only suppresses neuroinflammation but 
also protects against neurodegeneration in conditions such as multiple 
sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. This protective effect 
is achieved through different mechanisms including enhanced remyelination, 
reversal of synaptic and cognitive impairments, and mitigation of α-synuclein 
toxicity. Intriguingly, metabolic rerouting of fatty acids via SCD1 improves the 
pathology associated with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, suggesting 
context-dependent benign and harmful effects of SCD1 inhibition in the brain. 
Here, we summarize and discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying 
both the beneficial and detrimental effects of SCD1 in these neurological 
disorders. We explore commonalities and distinctions, shedding light on 
potential therapeutic challenges. Additionally, we touch upon future research 
directions that promise to deepen our understanding of SCD1 biology in brain 
disorders and potentially enhance the clinical utility of SCD1 inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder for which no effective therapy is currently available. Given that 
various attempts to target beta-amyloid (Aβ) have been unsuccessful in clinical 
trials, other potential pathogenic factors such as brain energy metabolism (EM) 
have attracted increasing attention. Traditional Chinese medicines, including 
danggui-shaoyao-san (DSS), play a notable role in AD. However, it remains 
unclear whether DSS exerts therapeutic effects on AD through EM regulation.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted behavioural tests, Nissl staining, 
haematoxylin and eosin staining, and thioflavin S staining, in APP/PS1 mice to 
assess the pharmacodynamic effect of DSS on AD. Subsequently, we integrated the 
drug target network of herbal ingredients in DSS and evaluated their absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties to identify the 
core ingredients. We used proteomic and metabolomic approaches to explore the 
potential mechanisms of action of DSS against AD. Consequently, we verified the 
mechanism underlying EM using qPCR, western blotting, and ELISA.
RESULTS: In vivo experimental results revealed that DSS ameliorated cognitive 
impairment in APP/PS1 mice, attenuated neuronal apoptosis, and reduced Aβ 
burden. Furthermore, the drug-target network comprised 6,514 drug-target 
interactions involving 1,118 herbal ingredients and 218 AD genes, of which 253 
were identified as the core ingredients in DSS. The proteomic results implied 
that DSS could act on EM to alleviate AD, and targeted energy metabolomics 
suggested that DSS regulated 47 metabolites associated with EM. Mechanistically, 
we found that DSS could regulate the GSK3β/PGC1α signalling pathway to improve 
brain glucose uptake and mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative 
stress, ultimately promoting EM to treat AD.
CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to integrate multi-omics approaches to reveal 
that DSS could regulate the GSK3β/PGC1α signalling pathway to exert therapeutic 
effects in AD through the promotion of EM, thereby providing new insights into 
the mechanism of action of DSS against AD.

BACKGROUND: Neural stem cells (NSCs) are considered to be the most promising 
cell type for cell replacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. However, 
their low neuronal differentiation ratio impedes their application in such 
conditions. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of NSC differentiation may 
provide the necessary experimental basis for expanding their application. 
Previous studies have indicated that POU3F4 can induce neuronal differentiation 
of NSCs, this study aims to underly the possible exact mechanism of POU3F4 on 
the NSC differentiation and development.
METHODS: NSCs were isolated and cultured from the hippocampus of neonatal mice. 
The frozen hippocampal sections were prepared for immunohistochemical staining. 
Synaptic development was assessed using electron microscopy. High-throughput 
sequencing was employed to analyze the gene expression profile following the 
overexpression of Brn4. Gene expression levels were determined through Western 
blotting and qRT-PCR. Cell cycle and differentiation were evaluated using flow 
cytometry and immunofluorescent staining.
RESULTS: It was found that POU3F4 promoted the neuronal differentiation of 
hippocampal NSCs and synapse development, and inhibited NSC proliferation. 
POU3F4-deficient mice exhibited impairments in learning and memory. RNA 
sequencing and ChIP assays confirmed that Gli1 was downstream of POU3F4. Loss 
and gain function experiments indicated that Gli1 mediated POU3F4 promoting 
neuronal differentiation and synapse development. Forced expression of Gli1 in 
hippocampus improved learning and memory function of animal models.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that POU3F4 and Gli1 promote neuronal 
differentiation and synaptic development of NSCs, and that Gli1 partially 
mediates the effects of POU3F4.

BACKGROUND: Headache is a pain disorder present in populations world-wide with a 
higher incidence in females. Specifically, the incidences of medication overuse 
headache (MOH) have increased worldwide. Comorbidities of MOH include 
photosensitivity, anxiety, "brain fog", and decreased physical activity. The 
FDA-approved long-lasting selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, formoterol, 
is currently approved for use in severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. Recently, interest in repurposing formoterol for use in other disorders 
including Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury and 
traumatic brain injury has gained traction. Thus, revisiting known side-effects 
of formoterol, like headache and anxiety, could inform treatment paradigms. The 
endocannabinoid (eCB) system is implicated in the etiology of preclinical 
headache, with observed decreases in the circulating levels of endogenous 
cannabinoids, referred to as Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency. As cross-talk 
between the eCB system and adrenergic receptors has been reported, this study 
investigated the role of the eCB system and ability of formoterol to induce 
headache-like periorbital allodynic behavior.
METHODS: Female 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were treated daily with formoterol (0.3 
mg/kg, i.p.) for up to 42-days, during which they were assessed for periorbital 
allodynia, open field/novel object recognition, and photosensitivity. At the end 
of the study, the periaqueductal grey (PAG), a brain region known to contribute 
to both headache induction and maintenance, was collected and subjected to LC-MS 
to quantify endocannabinoid levels.
RESULTS: Mice exhibited periorbital allodynia at nearly all time points tested 
and photosensitivity from 28-days onward. Levels of endocannabinoids, anandamide 
(AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), along with cannabinoid receptor 1 
(CB1R) expression were altered by both age and upon treatment with formoterol. 
Administration of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors, to target the eCB system, and a 
non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212 reversed the 
formoterol-induced periorbital allodynia.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that formoterol is dysregulates eCB tone to 
drive headache-like periorbital allodynic behaviors. These results could help 
inform preventative treatment options for individuals receiving formoterol, as 
well as provide information on the interaction between the eCB and adrenergic 
system.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading neurodegenerative disorder 
without effective treatments. The nonlinear dynamic nature of AD pathophysiology 
suggested that multiple pharmacological actions of anti-AD drugs should be 
elucidated. 9-Methylfascaplysin (9-MF) was previously designed and synthesized 
as a novel anti-AD candidate.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 9-MF at low concentrations significantly 
prevented cognitive impairments with similar efficacy as donepezil in APP/PS1 
transgenic mice. In addition, 9-MF potently reduced β-amyloid (Aβ)-associated 
neuroinflammation and tau-associated synaptic damage in vivo. 9-MF-regulated 
microglia-specific differentially phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) were mainly 
enriched in neuroinflammation, while 9-MF-regulated neuron-specific DPPs were 
enriched in synaptic regulation, as revealed by a quantitative phosphoproteomic 
approach. A phosphoproteome-kinome algorithm further identified that 
rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β 
(GSK3β) ranked high in 9-MF-downregulated kinase perturbations. 9-MF possessed 
high affinities for ROCK2 and GSK3β, which was confirmed by in vitro kinase 
activity assay. The protective effects of 9-MF were abolished by ROCK2 knockdown 
in Aβ-treated BV2 microglial cells, and by GSK3β knockdown in 
glyceraldehyde-treated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: All these results supported that 9-MF produced anti-AD effects via 
cell-specific inhibition of ROCK2 and GSK3β in microglia and neurons, 
respectively.

Maintaining body homeostasis is the ultimate key to health. There are rich 
resources of bioactive materials for the functionality of homeostatic modulators 
(HMs) from both natural and synthetic chemical repertories1-3. HMs are powerful 
modern therapeutics for human diseases including neuropsychiatric diseases, 
mental disorders, and drug addiction (e.g. Buspirone and benzodiazepines)4-7. 
However, the identification of therapeutic HMs are often unpredictable and 
limited to membrane protein receptors and ion channels. Based on a 
serendipitously encountered small molecule ZCL278 with partial agonist (PA) 
profile as a model compound8-10, the Mant-GTP fluorophore-based Cdc42-GEF 
(guanine nucleotide exchange factor) screening uncovered a near holistic 
spectrum of HMs for Cdc42, a cytoplasmic small GTPase in the Ras 
superfamily11,12. We categorized these HMs as functionally distinct, with some 
previously understudied classes: Class I-competitive PAs, Class II-hormetic 
agonists, Class III-bona fide inhibitors, Class IV-bona fide activators, and 
Class V-ligand-enhanced agonists. The model HMs elicited striking biological 
functionalities in modulating bradykinin activation of Cdc42 signaling as well 
as actin remodeling while they ameliorated Alzheimer's disease-like social 
behavior in mouse model. Furthermore, molecular structural modeling analyses led 
to the concept of preferential binding pocket order (PBPO) for profiling HMs 
that target Cdc42 complexed with intersectin (ITSN), a GEF selectively 
activating Cdc42. Remarkably, the PBPO enabled a prediction of HM class that 
mimics the pharmacological functionality. Therefore, our study highlights a 
model path to actively capture different classes of HM to broaden therapeutic 
landscape.

Pathophysiological evolutions in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not 
well understood. We used data of 2923 Olink plasma proteins from 51,296 
non-demented middle-aged adults. During a follow-up of 15 years, 689 incident AD 
cases occurred. Cox-proportional hazard models were applied to identify 
AD-associated proteins in different time intervals. Through linking to protein 
categories, changing sequences of protein z-scores can reflect 
pathophysiological evolutions. Mendelian randomization using blood protein 
quantitative loci data provided causal evidence for potentially druggable 
proteins. We identified 48 AD-related proteins, with CEND1, GFAP, NEFL, and SYT1 
being top hits in both near-term (HR:1.15-1.77; P:9.11 × 10-65-2.78 × 10-6) and 
long-term AD risk (HR:1.20-1.54; P:2.43 × 10-21-3.95 × 10-6). These four 
proteins increased 15 years before AD diagnosis and progressively escalated, 
indicating early and sustained dysfunction in synapse and neurons. Proteins 
related to extracellular matrix organization, apoptosis, innate immunity, 
coagulation, and lipid homeostasis showed early disturbances, followed by 
malfunctions in metabolism, adaptive immunity, and final synaptic and neuronal 
loss. Combining CEND1, GFAP, NEFL, and SYT1 with demographics generated 
desirable predictions for 10-year (AUC = 0.901) and over-10-year AD 
(AUC = 0.864), comparable to full model. Mendelian randomization supports 
potential genetic link between CEND1, SYT1, and AD as outcome. Our findings 
highlight the importance of exploring the pathophysiological evolutions in early 
stages of AD, which is essential for the development of early biomarkers and 
precision therapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by the accumulation of amyloid β protein (Aβ) and the hyper-phosphorylation of 
the microtubule-associated protein Tau. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 
plays a pivotal role in determining the fate of proteins, and its dysregulation 
can contribute to the buildup of Aβ and Tau. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), 
working in conjunction with activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating 
enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3), actively maintain the delicate balance 
of protein homeostasis. DUBs specifically remove ubiquitin tags from proteins 
marked for degradation, thereby averting their proteasomal breakdown. Several 
DUBs have demonstrated their capacity to regulate the levels of Aβ and Tau by 
modulating their degree of ubiquitination, underscoring their potential as 
therapeutic targets for AD. In this context, we present a comprehensive review 
of AD-associated DUBs and elucidate their physiological roles. Moreover, we 
delve into the current advancements in developing inhibitors targeting these 
DUBs, including the determination of cocrystal structures with their respective 
targets. Additionally, we assess the therapeutic efficacy of these inhibitors in 
AD, aiming to establish a theoretical foundation for future AD treatments.

The human visual system begins in the retina and projects to cortex through both 
the thalamocortical and retinotectal visual pathways. The thalamocortical system 
is divided into separate magnocellular and parvocellular divisions, which engage 
separate layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and project 
preferentially to the dorsal and ventral visual streams, respectively. The 
retinotectal system, in contrast, projects to the superior colliculus, pulvinar 
nucleus of the thalamus and amygdala. The pulvinar nucleus also plays a critical 
role in the integration of information processing across early visual 
regions.The functions of the visual system can be assessed using convergent EEG- 
and functional brain imaging approaches, increasingly supplemented by 
simultaneously collected eye-tracking information. These approaches may be used 
for tracing the flow of information from retina through early visual regions, as 
well as the contribution of these regions to higher-order cognitive processing. 
A pathway of increasing interest in relationship to neuropsychiatric disorders 
is the primate-specific "third visual pathway" that relies extensively on 
motion-related input and contributes preferentially to social information 
processing. Thus, disturbances in the brain's responsiveness to motion stimuli 
may be especially useful as biomarkers for early visual dysfunction related to 
impaired social cognition.Visual event-related potentials (ERPs) can be 
collected with high-fidelity and have proven effective for the study of 
neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, in 
which alterations in visual processing may occur early in the disorder, 
andautism-spectrum disorder (ASD), in which abnormal persistence of early 
childhood patterns may persist into adulthood, leading to impaired functioning 
of visual social pathways. The utility of visual ERPs as biomarkers for larger 
clinical studies is limited at present by the need for standardization of visual 
stimuli across laboratories, which requires specialized protocols and equipment. 
The development of optimized stimulation protocols as well as newer 
headset-based systems may increase the clinical utility of present stimulation 
approaches.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that has excellent 
temporal as well as good spatial resolution for measuring neural activity and 
has been extensively employed in cognitive neuroscience. However, MEG has only 
been more recently applied to investigations of brain networks and biomarkers in 
psychiatry. Besides providing new insights into the pathophysiology of major 
psychiatry syndromes, especially in schizophrenia, a major objective of current 
research is the identification of biomarkers that could inform early 
intervention and novel treatments. This chapter will provide a state-of-the-art 
overview of MEG as applied to schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and 
Alzheimer's disease, summarizing methodological approaches and studies 
investigating alterations during resting-state and task-related paradigms. In 
addition, we will highlight future methodological developments and their 
potential for applications of MEG in psychiatry.

Public-Private Partnerships for Neuropsychiatric Drug Development: A 
Perspective.

There is a long-standing interest in developing biomarkers for neuropsychiatric 
disorders that might assist in drug development or clinical management. To date, 
however, progress has been limited in part because of the limited nature of the 
studies and the absence of the types of large-scale networks that would be 
required for clinical validation. The first public-private partnership (PPP) for 
biomarker validation-the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-was 
formed in 2004 to focus on the development of amyloid deposition in the brain as 
a potential biomarker of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Over the past 20 years, 
ADNI has achieved many of its initial deliverables, while others remain a work 
in progress. ADNI also serves as a point of reference for other more recently 
established PPPs. Key components for PPP development include processes for 
identifying stakeholders and deliverables, governance and management, funding, 
and data access/sharing. These issues are discussed in relationship to more 
recently developed PPPs. Given the extensive investment needed for biomarker 
development within the pre-competitive space, PPPs provide a critical path for 
the development of next-generation tools for central nervous system (CNS) drug 
development.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
cognitive decline and progressive neuronal damage. Recent research has 
highlighted the significant roles of the gut microbiota and microRNAs (miRNAs) 
in the pathogenesis of AD. This review explores the intricate interaction 
between gut microbiota and miRNAs, emphasizing their combined impact on 
Alzheimer's progression. First, we discuss the bidirectional communication 
within the gut-brain axis and how gut dysbiosis contributes to neuroinflammation 
and neurodegeneration in AD. Changes in gut microbiota composition in 
Alzheimer's patients have been linked to inflammation, which exacerbates disease 
progression. Next, we delve into the biology of miRNAs, focusing on their roles 
in gene regulation, neurodevelopment, and neurodegeneration. Dysregulated miRNAs 
are implicated in AD pathogenesis, influencing key processes like inflammation, 
tau pathology, and amyloid deposition. We then examine how the gut microbiota 
modulates miRNA expression, particularly in the brain, potentially altering 
neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic plasticity. The interplay between gut 
microbiota and miRNAs also affects blood-brain barrier integrity, further 
contributing to Alzheimer's pathology. Lastly, we explore therapeutic strategies 
targeting this gut microbiota-miRNA axis, including probiotics, prebiotics, and 
dietary interventions, aiming to modulate miRNA expression and improve AD 
outcomes. While promising, challenges remain in fully elucidating these 
interactions and translating them into effective therapies. This review 
highlights the importance of understanding the gut microbiota-miRNA relationship 
in AD, offering potential pathways for novel therapeutic approaches aimed at 
mitigating the disease's progression.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive and radiation-free technique 
used for soft tissue. However, there are some limitations of the MRI modality, 
such as low sensitivity and poor image resolution. Artificially engineered 
magnetic nanoprobes have been extensively explored as a versatile platform for 
ultrasensitive MRI contrast agents due to their unique physiochemical 
characteristics and tunable magnetic properties. In this review, the emphasis is 
on recent progress in MRI nanoprobes with different structures and elements, 
including gadolinium-, iron-, manganese-based and metal-free nanoprobes. The key 
influencing factors and advanced engineering strategies for modulating the 
relaxation ratio of MRI nanoprobes are systematically condensed. Furthermore, 
the widespread and noninvasive visualization applications of MRI nanoprobes for 
real time monitoring of major organs and accurate disease diagnosing, such as 
cerebrovascular, ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, liver fibrosis, whole-body 
tumors, inflammation, as well as multi-mode imaging applications are summarized. 
Finally, the challenges and prospects for the future development of MRI 
nanoprobes are discussed, and promising strategies are specifically emphasized 
for improving biocompatibility, precisely engineering of optimal size, AI-driven 
prediction and design, and multifunctional self-assembly to enhance diagnostics. 
This review will provide new inspiration for artificial engineering and 
nanotechnology-based molecular probes for medical diagnosis and therapy with 
ultrasensitive MRI.

Treating cognitive impairment is a holy grail of modern clinical neuroscience. 
In the past few years, non-invasive brain stimulation is increasingly emerging 
as a therapeutic approach to ameliorate performance in patients with cognitive 
impairment and as an augmentation approach in persons whose cognitive 
performance is within normal limits. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, 
better understanding of brain connectivity and function has allowed for the 
development of different non-invasive brain stimulation protocols. Recent 
studies have shown that transcranial stimulation methods enhancing brain 
plasticity with several modalities have beneficial effects on cognitive 
functions. Amelioration has been shown in preclinical studies on behaviour of 
transgenic mouse models for Alzheimer's pathology and in clinical studies with 
variable severity of cognitive impairment. While the field is still grappling 
with issues related to the standardization of target population, frequency, 
intensity, treatment duration and stimulated region, positive outcomes have been 
reported on cognitive functions and on markers of brain pathology. Here we 
review the most encouraging protocols based on repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial alternating 
current stimulation, visual-auditory stimulation, photobiomodulation and 
transcranial focused ultrasound, which have demonstrated efficacy to enhance 
cognitive functions or slow cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease. Beneficial non-invasive brain stimulation effects on cognitive 
functions are associated with the modulation of specific brain networks. The 
most promising results have been obtained targeting key hubs of higher-level 
cognitive networks, such as the frontal-parietal network and the default mode 
network. The personalization of stimulation parameters according to individual 
brain features sheds new light on optimizing non-invasive brain stimulation 
protocols for future applications.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, predominantly 
affects individuals over the age of 65 and poses significant challenges in terms 
of effective management and treatment. The disease's pathogenesis involves 
complex molecular pathways including misfolded proteins accumulation, 
neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Recent insights have highlighted 
the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as critical regulators within these pathways, 
where they influence gene expression and contribute to the pathophysiological 
landscape of AD. Notably, emerging research has demonstrated that polyphenols, 
including curcumin, might modulate miRNA activity, thus offering a novel 
approach to mitigate AD symptoms and progression. This review explores the 
potential mechanisms through which polyphenols regulate miRNA expression and 
activity, specifically focusing on autophagy enhancement and inflammation 
reduction in the context of AD. We provide a detailed examination of key studies 
linking miRNA dysregulation to AD pathogenesis and discuss how polyphenols might 
correct these aberrations. The findings presented here underscore the 
therapeutic potential of polyphenols in AD treatment via miRNA modulation, 
pointing to new directions in disease management strategies and highlighting the 
need for targeted research into miRNA-based interventions.

All biological systems have adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette (ABC) 
transporters, one of the significant protein superfamilies involved in transport 
across membranes. ABC transporters have been implicated in the etiology of 
diseases like metabolic disorders, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. ATP-binding 
cassette superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), one of the ABC transporters, is 
necessary for the ATP-dependent efflux of several endogenous and exogenous 
substances. Consequently, it maintained cellular homeostasis and shielded tissue 
from xenobiotic substances. ABCG2 was initially identified in an 
Adriamycin-selected breast cancer cell line (MCF-7/AdrVp) and was linked to the 
emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancerous cells. Under many 
pathophysiological conditions, including inflammation, disease pathology, tissue 
injury, infection, and in response to xenobiotics and endogenous substances, the 
expression of ABCG2 undergoes alterations that result in modifications in its 
function and activity. Genetic variants in the ABCG2 transporter can potentially 
impact its expression and function, contributing to the development of many 
disorders. This review aimed to illustrate the impact of ABCG2 expression and 
its variants on oral drug bioavailability, MDR in specific cancer cells, explore 
the relationship between ABCG2 expression and other disorders such as gout, 
Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and erythropoietic protoporphyria, and 
demonstrate the influence of various synthetic and natural compounds in 
regulating ABCG2 expression.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most successful targets for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of AChE can result in 
preventing AD. In this context, the machine-learning (ML) model, molecular 
docking, and molecular dynamics calculations were employed to characterize the 
potential inhibitors for AChE from MedChemExpress (MCE) database. The trained ML 
model was initially employed for estimating the inhibitory of MCE compounds. 
Atomistic simulations including molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
simulations were then used to confirm ML outcomes. In particular, the physical 
insights into the ligand binding to AChE were clarified over the calculations. 
Two compounds, PubChem ID of 130467298 and 132020434, were indicated that they 
can inhibit AChE.

pathology in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.

Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are small cytoplasmic proteins involved in 
intracellular lipid transport and bind free fatty acids, cholesterol, and 
retinoids. FABP3, the major neuronal FABP in the adult brain, is upregulated in 
the CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise role of 
neuronal FABPs in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. This study investigates the 
contribution of fabp, the Drosophila homolog of FABP3 and FABP7, to amyloid β 
(Aβ) pathology using a Drosophila model. Neuronal knockdown of fabp shortened 
the lifespan of flies and increased age-related protein aggregates in the brain. 
In an AD model, fabp knockdown in neurons increased Aβ accumulation and 
Aβ-induced neurodegeneration, whereas fabp overexpression ameliorated Aβ 
pathology. Notably, fabp overexpression stimulated autophagy, which was 
inhibited by the knockdown of Eip75B, the Drosophila homolog of the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). The PPAR activator rosiglitazone 
restored autophagy impaired by fabp knockdown and reduced fabp knockdown-induced 
increased Aβ aggregation and cell death. Furthermore, knockdown of either fabp 
or Eip75B in the wing imaginal disc or adult fly brain reduced the expression of 
Atg6 and Atg8a. Additionally, treatment of the fabp knockdown AD model flies 
with polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid or linoleic acid, 
partially alleviated cell death in the developing eye, restored impaired 
autophagy flux, reduced Aβ aggregation, and attenuated Aβ-induced cell death. 
Our results suggest that Drosophila fabp plays an important role in maintaining 
protein homeostasis during aging and protects neurons from Aβ-induced cell death 
by enhancing autophagy through the PPAR pathway. These findings highlight the 
potential importance of neuronal FABP function in AD pathogenesis.

IMPORTANCE: Discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors when initiating memantine in 
patients with dementia may be reasonable to reduce treatment burden, costs, and 
the risk of adverse drug events.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of cholinesterase inhibitor discontinuation 
on long-term care institutionalization among older adults with dementia who 
initiate memantine.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective propensity score-matched 
cohort study used Medicare claims data from January 2014 to December 2019. 
Participants included fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with dementia. Data 
were analyzed from September 2021 to August 2024.
EXPOSURES: Discontinuation vs continuation of cholinesterase inhibitor.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 1-year long-term care 
institutionalization-free days. Secondary outcomes include all-cause death and 
adverse drug events over 1 year. We performed subgroup analyses based on age, 
sex, dementia type (Alzheimer disease vs other), frailty, and dementia severity 
(mild vs moderate or severe) based on claims-based algorithms. The primary 
outcome was analyzed using nonparametric restricted mean survival time analysis.
RESULTS: Among 16 292 beneficiaries who initiated memantine, 1820 (11.2%) 
discontinued cholinesterase inhibitors. In the propensity score-matched cohort 
of 3612 beneficiaries, the mean (SD) age was 80.7 (6.7) years, 2261 (62.6%) were 
female, and 1989 (55.0%) had a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Over 1 year, 
long-term care institutionalization occurred in 51 of 1806 beneficiaries (2.8%) 
who discontinued cholinesterase inhibitors (3.4 per 100 person-years) and 62 of 
1806 beneficiaries (3.4%) who continued (4.1 per 100 person-years). There was no 
statistically significant difference in the 1-year mean 
institutionalization-free days between discontinuation and continuation groups 
(360.6 [95% CI, 359.3 to 362.0] days vs 359.1 [95% CI, 357.5 to 360.6] days; 
mean difference, 1.5 [95% CI,-0.5 to 3.6] days). The mean difference in the 
long-term care institutionalization-free days did not differ by age category, 
sex, dementia type, frailty, or dementia stage. Individuals who discontinued had 
a lower rate of fall-related injury (0.9 vs 2.0 per 100 person-years; hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.47 [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.88]). There was no difference between the 
discontinuation and continuation groups in all-cause death (10.4 vs 11.6 per 100 
person-years; HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.72 to 1.10]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, discontinuing cholinesterase 
inhibitors upon memantine initiation was not associated with an increased risk 
of long-term care institutionalization but with a lower risk of fall-related 
injury among older adults with dementia. These findings offer valuable insights 
for clinicians aiming to reduce treatment burden in this population.

Turkey. ebruozturk@erciyes.edu.tr.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of psoralidin, a natural 
phenolic coumarin compound, on MK-801-induced neurotoxicity that may cause 
Alzheimer's disease and to determine the phosphodiesterase (PDE)-related 
molecular mechanism of action.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, neurotoxicity was performed using the 
MK-801 in the HT-22 cell line. The effects of compounds on the proliferation of 
HT-22 cells were determined by Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA). After measuring 
the total protein concentration, the PDE4A protein level was determined using 
the Western blot method.
RESULTS: Psoralidin (100, 200, 400 µM) has been shown to have a neuroprotective 
effect against MK-801-induced neurotoxicity, as indicated by Real-Time Cell 
Analysis. In HT-22 cells, the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) value 
of psoralidin was calculated to be 230.4 µM, IC50 value of MK-801 was calculated 
to be 62.4 µM at 24 hours. It has been determined that psoralidin (200, 400 µM) 
inhibits PDE4A by using the Western blot method.
CONCLUSIONS: This research uncovers that psoralidin has neuroprotective effects 
in MK801-associated accumulation of the excitatory amino acid glutamate 
neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in several chronic pathological conditions, 
leading to cell death and injury. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) have several overlapping mechanisms as they are both 
characterized by increased oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, 
and autophagy dysfunction. The objective of this study was to elucidate the 
possible neuroprotective effect of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), against hydrogen peroxide-induced 
neurotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons derived from wild-type (WT) and 
transgenic AD rats (TgF344-AD). An in vitro oxidative stress model was 
established using hydrogen peroxide to induce damage to neurons. Empagliflozin 
pretreatment was tested on this model initially through a cell viability assay. 
Flow cytometry and cell sorting were employed to discriminate the apoptotic and 
necrotic neuronal cell populations. Finally, the morphological and morphometric 
features of the neurons, including dendritic length and spine density, were 
evaluated using the SNT ImageJ plug-in following immunostaining with GFP. Sholl 
analysis was used to evaluate the impact of empagliflozin and hydrogen peroxide 
on dendritic arborization. Empagliflozin tended to ameliorate hydrogen 
peroxide-induced toxicity in primary neurons derived from WT rats and led to the 
preservation of dendritic spine density in both WT and TgF344-AD neurons 
(one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). A modest improvement in dendrites' length was also 
observed. Empagliflozin pretreatment can partially mitigate dendritic and spine 
alterations induced by hydrogen peroxide in primary neurons. These results 
underscore the impact of empagliflozin on neuronal morphology and highlight its 
potential as a candidate for the treatment and/or prevention of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Patterns of signal from tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) 
confined to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) or extended into the neocortex may be 
relevant for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research if they are linked to 
differential biomarker levels and cognitive decline.
METHODS: Visual assessment of Tau-PET [F-18]florquinitau (FQT) exams from 728 
initially non-demented older adults yielded four uptake groups: tau-negative 
(T-), MTL-only (T+MTL), neocortex-only (T+Neo), or both (T+MTL&Neo). Mixed 
effects models assessed group differences in retrospective cognitive and plasma 
pTau217 trajectories.
RESULTS: T+MTL&Neo was the most common T+ group (n = 97; 93% A+) and exhibited 
the sharpest worsening in cognitive and pTau217 trajectories before tau PET.
DISCUSSION: The T+MTL&Neo category represents an intermediate to advanced stage 
of AD preceded by rising ptau217 and progressive cognitive decline. The pTau217 
finding suggests that A+, T+ in MTL or neocortex could represent early AD 
stages, with a higher likelihood of progressing to more advanced stages.
HIGHLIGHTS: Visual assessments of Tau-PET FQT revealed four distinct uptake 
groups: tau-negative (T-), MTL-only (T+MTL), neocortex-only (T+Neo), or both 
(T+MTL&Neo). Amyloid positive participants in the T+MTL and T+MTL&Neo categories 
showed a retrospectively faster decline in their cognitive trajectories, and a 
sharper increase in pTau217 levels in plasma, compared to T-. The T+MTL&Neo 
group displayed sharper trajectories compared with the other Tau positive groups 
in both their cognitive scores and pTau217 plasma levels. Our results suggest 
that participants with Tau present in both MTL and neocortex represent an 
intermediate to advanced stage of AD, whereas participants with signals confined 
to either MTL or neocortex could represent earlier AD stages.

BACKGROUND: The history from a relative or caregiver is an important tool for 
differentiating neurodegenerative disease. We characterized patterns of 
caregiver questionnaire responses, at diagnosis and follow-up, on the Cambridge 
Behavioural Inventory (CBI).
METHODS: Data-driven multivariate analysis (n = 4952 questionnaires) was 
undertaken for participants (n = 2481) with Alzheimer's disease 
(typical/amnestic n = 543, language n = 50, and posterior cortical n = 50 
presentations), Parkinson's disease (n = 740), dementia with Lewy bodies 
(n = 55), multiple system atrophy (n = 55), progressive supranuclear palsy 
(n = 422), corticobasal syndrome (n = 176), behavioral variant frontotemporal 
dementia (n = 218), semantic (n = 125) and non-fluent variant progressive 
aphasia (n = 88), and motor neuron disease (n = 12).
RESULTS: Item-level support vector machine learning gave high diagnostic 
accuracy between diseases (area under the curve mean 0.83), despite 
transdiagnostic changes in memory, behavior, and everyday function. There was 
progression in CBI subscores over time, which varied by diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: Our results highlight the differential diagnostic information for a 
wide range of neurodegenerative diseases contained in a simple, structured 
collateral history.
HIGHLIGHTS: We analyzed 4952 questionnaires from caregivers of 2481 participants 
with neurodegenerative disease. Behavioral and neuropsychiatric manifestations 
of neurodegenerative disease had overlapping diagnostic boundaries. Simple 
questionnaire response patterns were sufficient for accurate diagnosis of each 
disease. We reinforce the value of a collateral history to support a diagnosis 
of dementia. The Cambridge Behavioural Inventory is sensitive to change over 
time and suitable as an outcome measure in clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: Collaborative dementia care models with care navigation, including 
the Care Ecosystem, improve outcomes for persons living with dementia (PLWDs) 
and their caregivers. The effects of continuous care over long periods have not 
been studied.
METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial with 456 PLWD-caregiver dyads with 
high caregiver burden, we evaluated the cumulative 5-year treatment effect on 
PLWD quality of life, health care utilization, caregiver depression, 
self-efficacy, and burden.
RESULTS: Five-year participation was associated with higher quality of life, 
lower caregiver depression, and higher caregiver self-efficacy (all p's < 0.05) 
with a trend for lower burden (p = 0.07). Treatment effects were most robust 
during the first 2 years. The effects on emergency department visits and 
hospitalizations were not significant.
DISCUSSION: The benefits of collaborative dementia care on PLWD quality of life 
and caregiver well-being are sustained for 5 years, and the dyads may experience 
the greatest benefit during the first 2 years.
HIGHLIGHTS: Collaborative dementia care with care navigation was evaluated over 
5 years using a randomized clinical trial. The care was associated with better 
quality of life for the person with dementia and well-being for the caregiver. 
The most robust treatment effects were in the first 2 years.

INTRODUCTION: Marmosets spontaneously develop pathological hallmarks of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) including amyloid beta plaques. However, tau expression 
in the marmoset brain has been understudied.
METHODS: Isoforms of tau were examined by western blot, mass spectrometry, 
immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: 3R and 4R tau isoforms are expressed in marmoset brains at both the 
transcript and protein levels across ages. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed 
that tau peptides in marmoset corresponded to the 3R and 4R peptides in human 
brain, with 3R predominating at birth and an ≈40%:60% 3R:4R ratios in 
adolescents and adults; tau was distributed widely in neurons, with localization 
in the soma and synaptic regions. Phosphorylation residues were observed on 
Threonine (Thr) Thr181, Thr217, Thr231, Serine (Ser) Ser202/Thr205, and 
Ser396/Ser404.
DISCUSSION: Our results confirm both 3R and 4R tau isoform expression and 
phosphorylation residues in the marmoset brain, and emphasize the significance 
of marmosets with natural expression of AD-related hallmarks as important 
translational models for AD. Highlights We report comprehensive characterization 
of tau isoform expression in marmoset brains across the lifespan. 3R and 4R tau 
isoforms are expressed in marmoset brains at both the transcript and protein 
levels across ages. These data emphasize the significance of marmosets with 
natural expression of primate-specific traits that are important for the study 
of Alzheimer's disease.

Nanjing Medical University, 264 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China,

BACKGROUND: The preceding evidence indicates a close correlation between 
imbalances in the gut microbiome and Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the direct 
causal relationship remains unclear. Our objective is to investigate this 
potential causal connection.
METHODS: We obtained summary results from two significant genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) on gut microbiota (the MibioGen consortium and the 
Dutch Microbiome Project), along with one GWAS summary result for AD. Using a 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis, we examined the potential 
causal effects of gut microbiota on AD.
RESULTS: Our TSMR analysis revealed that 16 gut bacterial taxa were linked to a 
reduced risk of AD. These included phylum Tenericutes, classes Bacilli and 
Clostridia along with its order Clostridiales, family Bacteroidaceae, genus 
Bacteroides, and species Bifidobacterium bifidum (OR: 0.867~0.971, P ≤ 0.045). 
Conversely, the presence of 12 taxa correlated with an increased risk of AD. 
These comprised class Actinobacteria and its family Coriobacteriaceae, as well 
as class Betaproteobacteria, its order Burkholderiales, and its family 
Sutterellaceae (OR: 1.042~1.140, P ≤ 0.035).
CONCLUSION: Our research uncovered evidence suggesting certain gut bacterial 
species might play a causal role in AD risk, providing a fresh angle for AD 
treatment strategies.

Avenue, Purchase, NY 10577, acaggiano@cogrx.com.

BACKGROUND: CT1812 is a first-in-class, sigma-2 receptor ligand, that prevents 
and displaces binding of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers. Normalization of 
quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) markers suggests that CT1812 protects 
synapses from Aβ oligomer toxicity.
OBJECTIVES: Evaluate CT1812 impact on synaptic function using qEEG measurements.
DESIGN: Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week crossover 
study.
SETTING: VU University Medical Center and Brain Research Center Amsterdam, The 
Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD).
INTERVENTION: A daily 300 mg dose of CT1812 or placebo for 4 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: A resting-state, eyes closed qEEG assessment occurred on Day 1 and 
on Day 29 of Treatment Periods 1 and 2, and at follow-up. The primary endpoint 
was global relative theta power (4-8 Hz), along with secondary EEG measures 
including global alpha corrected Amplitude Envelope Correlation (AEC-c). 
Cognitive and functional assessments, fluid biomarkers, and safety and 
tolerability were assessed.
RESULTS: 16 patients were randomized, and 15 completed. A non-significant 
(p=0.123) but consistent reduction occurred in global relative theta power and 
in relative theta power in frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and central 
(p<0.006) brain regions with CT1812. A nominally significant (p=0.034) 
improvement was observed in global alpha AEC-c. Adverse events occurred in 11 
patients with CT1812 and 6 with placebo - most commonly nausea, diarrhea, and 
procedural headache. No severe or serious AEs, deaths or discontinuations were 
reported.
CONCLUSION: CT1812 improved established EEG markers of spontaneous brain 
activity (spectral power, functional connectivity) in patients with 
mild-to-moderate AD, suggesting improved neuronal/synaptic function within a 
4-week timespan.

BACKGROUND: The functions of regulated cell death (RCD) are closely related to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, very few studies have systematically 
investigated the diagnosis and immunologic role of RCD-related genes in AD 
patients.
METHODS: 8 multicenter AD cohorts were included in this study, and then were 
merged into a meta cohort. Then, an unsupervised clustering analysis was carried 
out to detect unique subtypes of AD based on RCD-related genes. Subsequently, 
differently expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted correlation network analysis 
(WGCNA) between subtypes were identified. Finally, to establish an optimal risk 
model, an RCD.score was constructed by using computational algorithm (10 
machine-learning algorithms, 113 combinations).
RESULTS: We identified two distinct subtypes based on RCD-related genes, each 
exhibiting distinct hallmark pathway activity and immunologic landscape. 
Specifically, cluster.A patients had a higher immune infiltration, a higher 
immune modulators and poor AD progression. Utilizing the shared DEGs and WGCNA 
of these subtypes, we constructed an RCD.score that demonstrated excellent 
predictive ability in AD across multiple datasets. Furthermore, RCD.score was 
identified to exhibit the strongest association with poor AD progression. 
Mechanistically, we observed activation of signaling pathways and effective 
immune infiltration and immune modulators in the high RCD.score group, thus 
leading to a poor AD progression. Additionally, Mendelian randomization 
screening revealed four genes (CXCL1, ENTPD2, METTL7A, and SERPINB6) as feature 
genes for AD.
CONCLUSION: The RCD model is a valuable tool in categorizing AD patients. This 
model can be of great assistance to clinicians in determining the most suitable 
personalized treatment plan for each individual AD patient.

Unveiling Potential Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid for Amyloid Pathological 
Positivity in Non-Demented Individuals.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary 
tangles. The recent approval of anti-amyloid therapeutic medications highlights 
the crucial need for early detection of Aβ pathological abnormalities in 
individuals without dementia to facilitate timely intervention and treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to identify cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) biomarkers strongly associated with Aβ pathological positivity in a 
non-demented cohort and evaluate their clinical values.
METHODS: A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 51 CSF proteins (excluding 
Aβ42, pTau, and Tau) obtained from 474 non-demented participants sourced from 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. By utilizing 
the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, we 
identified potential proteins indicative of Aβ pathological positivity and 
evaluated their performance in tracking longitudinal pathological progression.
RESULTS: Our LASSO analysis unveiled three candidates: apolipoprotein E (APOE), 
chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding 
protein 1 (SMOC1). While SMOC1 did not correlate with Aβ42-related cognitive 
alterations, it displayed better abilities in discriminating both CSF-Aβ 
positivity and Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET) positivity than the other 
two candidates. It could precisely predict longitudinal Aβ-PET status 
conversion. Notably, SMOC1 was the only protein showing associations with 
longitudinal Aβ-PET trajectory and enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of Aβ42. 
The assessment of combined Aβ42 and SMOC1 yielded valuable clinical insights.
CONCLUSION: Our findings elucidated SMOC1 as a potential biomarker for detecting 
Aβ abnormalities. Aβ42 combining SMOC1 offered critical implications in AD 
pathological diagnosis and management.

BACKGROUND: The Everyday Cognition (ECog) 12-item scale, a functional decline 
measurement, can distinguish dementia from cognitively unimpaired (CU). Limited 
data compare ECog-12 performance by raters (self vs. informant) and scoring 
systems (average numeric vs. categorical grouping) to differentiate cognitive 
statuses.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of ECog-12 in differentiation cognitive 
statuses.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional diagnostic test study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) study are analyzed. Participants were aged 55-90 years old 
divided into subgroups based on diagnostic criteria.
MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated ECog-12 performance across different diagnostic 
groups, such as CU vs cognitive impairment (CI; mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 
and dementia), and the association between ECog-12 and CI. This procedure was 
repeated for self- and partner (informant)-reports. Additionally, types of ECog 
scores were also assessed, where an average ECog score was calculated 
(continuous numeric) as well as a categorical grouping ("any occasional 
declined" or "any consistently declined") based on item-level responses to ECog 
questions.
RESULTS: ECog-12 cut-off scores of 1.36 (self-reported) and 1.45 
(partner-reported) distinguish CU from CI with AUC 0.7 and 0.78, respectively. 
Adding a memory-concern question improved self-reported-ECog AUC to 0.79. Self- 
and partner-reported "consistently-declined" ECog-12 categorical grouping 
provided AUC 0.69 and 0.78. The study partner reported ECog-12 showed a greater 
association with CI than self-reported, with odds ratios of 35.45 and 8.79, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Study partner-reported ECog scores performed better than 
self-reported ECog-12 in differentiating cognitive statuses, and a higher study 
partner reported ECog score was a higher prognostic risk for CI. A memory 
concern question could enhance self-reported ECog-12 performance. This further 
emphasizes the need to obtain data from study partners for research and clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: A decline in episodic memory is one of the earliest cognitive 
characteristics of Alzheimer disease and memory tests are heavily featured in 
cognitive composite endpoints that are used to demonstrate treatment efficacy. 
Assessments of episodic memory can take many forms including free recall, 
associate learning, and paragraph or story recall. Plasma biomarkers of 
Alzheimer disease are now widely available and will likely form the backbone of 
cohort enrichment strategies for future clinical trials. Thus, it is critical to 
evaluate which episodic memory measures are most sensitive to plasma markers of 
Alzheimer disease pathology.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the associations of common episodic memory tests with 
plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease.
DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.
SETTING: Academic medical center in the midwestern United States.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 161 cognitively normal older adults with at least one 
plasma biomarker assessment and two or more annual clinical and cognitive 
assessments which included up to three different tests of episodic memory.
MEASUREMENTS: Episodic memory performance using free recall, paired associates 
recall or paragraph recall. Plasma Aβ42, Aβ40, ptau217, and neurofilament light 
chain were measured.
RESULTS: Free recall on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test with 
Immediate Recall (FCSRT + IR) was substantially more sensitive to longitudinal 
cognitive change associated with abnormal baseline plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and ptau217 
compared to other measures of episodic memory. A cognitive composite that 
included only free recall showed larger decline associated with baseline 
Aβ42/Aβ40 when compared to those that included paragraph recall. Differences in 
decline across composites were minimal when considering baseline ptau217 or NfL.
CONCLUSION: Episodic memory is a critical domain to assess in preclinical 
Alzheimer disease. Methods of assessing memory are not equal and longitudinal 
change in free recall substantially outperformed both paired associates and 
paragraph recall. Clinical trial results will depend critically on the episodic 
memory test(s) that are chosen for a composite endpoint and free recall from the 
FCSRT + IR is an optimal memory measure to include rather than paired associates 
or paragraph recall.

Roles of TREM2 in the Pathological Mechanism and the Therapeutic Strategies of 
Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related degenerative disease, which is 
characteristic by the deposition of senile plaques (SP) outside the cells, the 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) inside the neurons, and the loss of synapse and 
neurons. Neuroinflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. 
Microglia are the immune cells in the central nervous system. However, microglia 
might become disease-related microglia (DAMs) when stimulated by the external 
environment. DAMs have been shown to be involved in a series of events of AD 
development including Aβ accumulation and tau phosphorylation. The triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane receptor that 
is mainly expressed by microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). TREM2 
plays an important role in the physiological function of microglia, and the 
dyshomeostasis of TREM2 is related to the development of late-onset AD. This 
article summarized the latest advances in TREM2 biology and its impact on the 
roles of microglia in AD development, with a particular emphasis on the 
structure, ligands, signal transduction, and the agonistic antibodies of TREM2 
for AD treatment. We further discussed the survival, migration, phagocytosis, 
inflammation, and cellular metabolism of microglia, as well as the role of 
sTREM2 in neuroprotection and as a biomarker for AD. It provides a reference for 
further research on the molecular mechanism of microglial TREM2 in the 
occurrence and development of AD and on the therapeutic strategies targeted on 
the microglial TREM2.

BACKGROUND: Arterial hypertension contributes to both the development and 
progression of dementia due to both Alzheimer's disease (A.D.) and vascular 
pathology. However, the effects of different classes of anti-hypertensives 
(A.H.T.s), on the rate of dementia progression and brain neuropathology are 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of each class of A.H.T., both as single and 
combined, on the rate of dementia progression. In addition, we analyzed the 
effect of A.H.T.s on brain neuropathology in AD participants, indicated by Braak 
staging, hippocampal atrophy, and baseline CSF levels of A-β42, total (T) tau, 
and P-181 tau.
METHODS: We have used the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) 
Uniform Data Set (UDS).
RESULTS: A.H.T.s were associated with reduced yearly increase in the CDR-SOB 
scores of 1.025 during a 10-year follow-up (P<0.001). The overall survival rate 
was higher in A.H.T. users than non-users [HR: 0.912: 0.860, 0.967) P=0.002]. 
These trends continued when stratifying participants by age, gender, and APOE4 
allele. Participants who did not use A.H.T.s had a mean yearly increase of 
1.71±1.7 in the CDR-SOB scores. This value was reduced to 1.48±1.6, P=0.006 and 
1.45±1.6, P=0.024 for participants with documented use of βB and A.R.B.s, 
respectively. Combining diuretics with α1-AB or ACEI led to synergistic effects 
in reducing the rise in CDR-SOB scores. The proportion of participants who were 
diagnosed having AD postmortem with severe Braak staging was significantly lower 
in A.H.T.-users than non-users. The severity of Braak staging, and hippocampal 
atrophy differed in participants> 70 vs. <70 years old, in both males and 
females. A significant relationship was observed between hippocampal atrophy and 
Braak staging; and between hippocampal atrophy and baseline CSF levels of P-181 
tau.
CONCLUSION: Our results could have implications for halting the progression of 
dementia regardless of the etiology being related to AD or vascular pathology. 
The choice of combination of A.H.T. therapy should also consider the combination 
which would lead to an optimum benefit in slowing the progression of dementia. 
Additionally, our results underline a more complex A.D. disease model than 
previously thought, which opens new treatment options.

BACKGROUND: JNJ-63733657 (posdinemab) is a humanized IgG1/kappa monoclonal 
anti-phospho tau antibody that binds with high affinity to phosphorylated amino 
acid 217 (pT217) in the proline-rich domain. The parent molecule, PT3, was 
raised against Alzheimer's disease brain purified paired helical filament, and 
preclinical studies with the humanized version, JNJ-63733657, have demonstrated 
reductions in tau seeding. The results of the first-in-human clinical trial of 
JNJ-63733657 and a separate single ascending dose study in Japanese participants 
are presented.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-63733657 after single and multiple 
intravenous dose administrations in healthy participants and participants with 
prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease.
DESIGN: A two part first-in-human, phase 1, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial: Single ascending dose (Part 1) and multiple ascending 
dose (Part 2). And a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
single ascending dose trial in healthy Japanese participants.
SETTING: 7 sites in Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, and Germany; 1 site in Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 40 healthy participants aged 55-75 were enrolled in 
Part 1 of the first-in-human study; a total of 16 healthy participants and 13 
participants with prodromal or mild AD aged 55-80 years were enrolled in Part 2. 
In the Japanese trial, a total of 24 participants aged 55-75 were enrolled.
INTERVENTION: In Part 1, single doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg of 
JNJ-63733657 or placebo were administered to healthy participants. In Part 2, 
two dose levels of JNJ-63733657 (5 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) or placebo were evaluated 
in healthy participants, and 2 dose levels (15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) or placebo 
were evaluated in participants with Alzheimer's disease; doses were administered 
on Days 1, 29, and 57. In the Japanese trial, single doses of 3, 15, or 60 mg/kg 
of JNJ-63733675 or placebo were administered. All doses were administered 
intravenously.
MEASUREMENTS: Safety assessments, serum and cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetic 
parameters, immunogenicity, and cerebrospinal fluid pharmacodynamic changes in 
free and total p217+tau, total tau, and p181tau were evaluated.
RESULTS: JNJ-63733657 was generally safe and well-tolerated in healthy 
participants and participants with Alzheimer's disease. In healthy participants 
and participants with Alzheimer's disease, JNJ-63733657 demonstrated linear PK, 
and serum Cmax and AUC were approximately dose proportional following single and 
multiple doses. Dose-dependent reductions in free and total p217+tau in 
cerebrospinal fluid were observed. No changes in total tau or p181tau were 
observed in healthy participants whereas Alzheimer's disease participants showed 
decreases in these tau species following administration of JNJ-63733657.
CONCLUSION: In these Phase 1 trials, no safety or tolerability concerns were 
identified, and dose dependent reductions in p217+tau in the cerebrospinal fluid 
were demonstrated following administration of JNJ-63733657. The safety and 
biomarker profiles support the continued investigation of this compound for the 
slowing of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: On July 6, 2023 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approved the anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody lecanemab (Leqembi®) for treatment 
of patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Our early experience and lessons learned with lecanemab in a 
regional community medical center are described.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational study 
highlights the first 71 patients treated with lecanemab at our multidisciplinary 
Norton Neuroscience Institute Memory Center. All patients had positive 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and underwent at least 1 lecanemab 
infusion. Two patients had additional amyloid PET scans which were positive.
RESULTS: The mean age was 72 years (49-90 years), and 44 (62%) patients were 
female. Most were Caucasian (68 [96%]), and 54 [76%] were referred to our Memory 
Center by their primary care provider. Comorbidities were common, including 
hypertension (34 [48%]), hypercholesterolemia (51 [72%]), diabetes mellitus (17 
[24%]), and cardiovascular disease excluding hypertension (22 [31%]). The mean 
body mass index was 27.0 (range: 17.8-45.0). A total of 36 (51%) patients were 
heterozygous for the ApoE4 genotype, and 9 (13%) were homozygous. A total of 61 
[86%] patients had been treated with donepezil; 40 (56%) patients had received 
memantine. Of the 50 patients who completed 1 or more safety monitoring brain 
MRIs following infusion, 12 (24%) had amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
(ARIA) detected: solitary ARIA-H (hemorrhage) in 5, solitary ARIA-E (edema) in 
3, and both ARIA-H and ARIA-E in 4. Of the 12 patients with ARIA, 9 were 
asymptomatic, 4 were homozygous for the ApoE4 genotype, and 6 were heterozygous 
for the ApoE4 genotype. Of the 9 who were homozygous for the ApoE4 genotype in 
this study, 4 (44%) had evidence of ARIA. Of the 36 who were heterozygous for 
the ApoE4 genotype, 6 (17%) were diagnosed with ARIA. Twenty-six (37%) patients 
experienced infusion reactions after their first lecanemab infusion: headaches 
(12 patients) and shaking/chills/rigors (11 patients) were most common. 
Twenty-three (88%) of these 26 patients reported the side effects either at the 
infusion center or within the first 24 hours post-infusion. One patient died 
shortly after the first lecanemab infusion of a myocardial infarction. It is 
uncertain whether or not this death was related to lecanemab treatment.
CONCLUSION: Through our early experience with lecanemab, we have recognized 
several areas of improvement which have clarified and enhanced the lecanemab 
infusion experience.

Regional Prevention Plans.

BACKGROUND: Up to 40% of dementia cases are theoretically avoidable and 
population-level interventions (i.e., universal prevention) are a key component 
in facing the global public health challenge of dementia. However, information 
on the agenda for the universal prevention of dementia at the national and 
sub-national levels is still lacking.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide a comprehensive description of the universal 
prevention strategies specific to dementia in Italian regions and autonomous 
provinces (APs).
DESIGN: We conducted a document analysis of the 21 Italian Regional Prevention 
Plans (RPPs), with a focus on interventions that target potentially modifiable 
risk factors for dementia. We analysed the final version of the documents, which 
were previously downloaded from the dedicated section of the Italian Ministry of 
Health website in January 2023. We classified the interventions as direct, 
indirect, or absent. Additionally, we created a quality checklist to outline the 
essential programmatic elements and applied it to summarise the key findings of 
the RPPs.
MEASUREMENTS: We reported the number of population-level interventions specific 
for dementia with sub-national detail. We reported information on the risk 
factor targeted by the interventions, the age groups and populations they were 
designed for. We summarized the presence or absence of 63 programmatic items 
using a four-domain checklist.
RESULTS: We identified 248 interventions for dementia prevention among the 
assessed RPPs: 100% of the plans addressed physical inactivity; 30-35% addressed 
smoking, alcohol, obesity, and social isolation; 25% addressed hypertension, 
diabetes, and air pollution; only 5-10% addressed education, depression, and 
hearing loss. Most interventions targeted the general population. Quality 
checklist scores significantly varied among regions, with demographics and 
prevention strategies domains scoring higher than disease burden and 
intervention feasibility ones.
CONCLUSIONS: The population-level interventions in the Italian Regional 
Prevention Programs dedicated to dementia prevention primarily focus on vascular 
risk factors, with limited coverage of dementia-specific factors such as 
traumatic brain injury and hearing loss. This data should be considered when 
planning future interventions for dementia prevention.

ABSTRACT: Apathy is a quantitative reduction of goal-directed activity, which 
can be observed in relation to behavior, cognition, emotions and social 
interaction. It is an invalidating behavioral symptom that is frequently present 
across different psychiatric conditions and neurocognitive disorders including 
Korsakoff's Syndrome (KS). In fact, apathy is one of the most severe behavioral 
symptoms of KS and has a major impact on the lives of patients and their 
relatives and other informal caregivers. However, guidelines for the treatment 
of apathy in KS are currently not available. This systematic narrative review 
provides a transdiagnostic overview of the effectiveness of different types of 
non-pharmacological interventions on apathy across different study populations 
that at symptom-level share characteristics with KS. This evidence may inform 
the development of an intervention targeting apathy in KS. The included study 
populations are dementia (due to Alzheimer's disease, or vascular dementia), 
Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. Through a stepped 
selection approach and with regard to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 22 systematic reviews 
and 32 empirical articles on the non-pharmacological treatment of apathy were 
identified. The results show a variety of effective non-pharmacological 
interventions on apathy. In conditions with severe cognitive impairments, 
successful interventions did not rely on intrinsic motivation, self-monitoring, 
or illness insight of the patients, but depend on external stimulation and 
behavioral activation. Since apathy is a multidimensional construct, 
identification of the extent and type of apathetic behavior before starting an 
intervention is highly recommended. Furthermore, it is important to adjust the 
treatment to the patients' personal interests and needs and embedded in daily 
care.

BACKGROUND: Associations between longitudinal changes of plasma biomarkers and 
cerebral magnetic resonance (MR)-derived measurements in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) remain unclear.
METHODS: In a study population (n = 127) of healthy older adults and patients 
within the AD continuum, we examined associations between longitudinal plasma 
amyloid beta 42/40 ratio, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and 7T 
structural and functional MR imaging and spectroscopy using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Increases in both p-tau181 and GFAP showed the strongest associations 
to 7T MR-derived measurements, particularly with decreasing parietal cortical 
thickness, decreasing connectivity of the salience network, and increasing 
neuroinflammation as determined by MR spectroscopy (MRS) myo-inositol.
DISCUSSION: Both plasma p-tau181 and GFAP appear to reflect disease progression, 
as indicated by 7T MR-derived brain changes which are not limited to areas known 
to be affected by tau pathology and neuroinflammation measured by MRS 
myo-inositol, respectively.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study leverages high-resolution 7T magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging and MR spectroscopy (MRS) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarker 
insights. Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP) showed the largest changes over time, particularly in the 
AD group. p-tau181 and GFAP are robust in reflecting 7T MR-based changes in AD. 
The strongest associations were for frontal/parietal MR changes and MRS 
neuroinflammation.

Despite significant research efforts, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the primary 
cause of dementia in older adults worldwide, remains a neurological challenge 
for which there are currently no effective therapies. There are substantial 
financial, medical, and personal costs associated with this condition.Important 
pathological features of AD include hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated 
protein Tau, the formation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides from amyloid precursor 
protein (APP), and continuous inflammation that ultimately results in neuronal 
death. Important histological markers of AD, amyloid plaques, and 
neurofibrillary tangles are created when Aβ and hyperphosphorylated Tau 
build-up. Nevertheless, a thorough knowledge of the molecular players in AD 
pathophysiology is still elusive. Recent studies have shown how noncoding RNAs 
(ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 
circular RNAs (circRNAs), regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and 
posttranscriptional levels in a variety of diseases, including AD. There is 
increasing evidence to support the involvement of these ncRNAs in the genesis 
and progression of AD, making them promising as biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets. As a result, therapeutic approaches that target regulatory ncRNAs are 
becoming more popular as potential means of preventing the progression of AD. 
This review explores the posttranscriptional relationships between ncRNAs and 
the main AD pathways, highlighting the potential of ncRNAs to advance AD 
treatment. In AD, ncRNAs, especially miRNAs, change expression and present 
potential targets for therapy. MiR-346 raises Aβ through APP messenger 
Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA), whereas miR-107 may decrease Aβ by targeting beta-site 
amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). They are promising early AD 
biomarkers due to their stability in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. 
Furthermore, additional research is necessary to determine the role that RNA 
fragments present in AD-related protein deposits play in AD pathogenesis.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is predominantly located in synapses of neurons 
and its mutations have been well recognized as the most important genetic causal 
factor for the familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). While most disease-causal 
mutations of APP occur within the Aβ-coding region or immediately proximal, the 
pathological impacts of mutations in the N-terminus of APP protein, which remote 
from the Aβ sequence, on neuron and synapse are still largely unknown. It was 
recently reported a pathogenic APP N-terminal Val225Ala mutation (APPV225A) with 
clinically featuring progressive dementia and typical AD pathologies in brain. 
In our present study, we further found that APPV225A mutation alters the 
N-terminal structure of APP, which enhances its binding affinity to tau protein 
and significantly increases APP-mediated endocytosis. Consequently, APPV225A 
promotes the uptake of extracellular tau into SH-SY5Y cells, further linking the 
structural change in APP to intracellular tau accumulation. In addition, 
APPV225A also notably alters the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of 
intracellular tau and intensified tau phosphorylation and aggregation in SH-SY5Y 
cells. Moreover, APPV225A promote AD-like tau pathology and synaptic damages in 
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived neural progenitor cells 
and neurons, as well as in hiPSCs-derived human brain organoids and mouse brain, 
which can be ameliorated by tau knockdown. Proximity labeling identified several 
key APPV225A-interacting proteins, including HS3ST3A1, which was shown to 
directly regulate tau LLPS and phosphorylation. These findings nicely build on 
our previous work on roles for APP in tau-related pathological phenotypes and 
further highlight the involvement of N-terminal APP as the key region for both 
amyloidopathy and tauopathy, two aspects of AD pathogenesis and progression. Our 
study may also provide a theoretical breakthrough for AD therapy and highlight 
the important hub roles of APP and making previously neglected N-terminal APP as 
a potential target for the discovery of novel disease-modifying therapeutic 
agents against AD, holding significant scientific values and clinical promise.

To identify circRNAs associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) we leveraged two 
of the largest publicly available studies with longitudinal clinical and blood 
transcriptomic data. We performed a cross-sectional study utilizing the last 
visit of each participant (N = 1848), and a longitudinal analysis that included 
1166 participants with at least two time points. We identified 192 
differentially expressed circRNAs, with effects that were sustained during 
disease, in mutation carriers, and diverse ancestry. The 192 circRNAs were 
leveraged to distinguish between PD and healthy participants with a ROC AUC of 
0.797. Further, 71 circRNAs were sufficient to distinguish between genetic PD 
(AUC71 = 0.954) and, at-risk participants (AUC71 = 0.929) and healthy controls, 
supporting that circRNAs have the potential to aid the diagnosis of PD. Finally, 
we identified five circRNAs highly correlated with symptom severity. Overall, we 
demonstrated that circRNAs play an important role in PD and can be clinically 
relevant to improve diagnostic and monitoring.

Disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are likely to be most 
beneficial when initiated in the presymptomatic phase. To track the benefit of 
such interventions, fluid biomarkers are of great importance, with neurofilament 
light chain protein (NfL) showing promise for monitoring neurodegeneration and 
predicting cognitive outcomes. Here, we update and complement previous findings 
from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Observational Study by using 
matched cross-sectional and longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma 
samples from 567 individuals, allowing timely comparative analyses of CSF and 
blood trajectories across the entire disease spectrum. CSF and plasma 
trajectories were similar at presymptomatic stages, discriminating mutation 
carriers from non-carrier controls 10-20 years before the estimated onset of 
clinical symptoms, depending on the statistical model used. However, after 
symptom onset the rate of change in CSF NfL continued to increase steadily, 
whereas the rate of change in plasma NfL leveled off. Both plasma and CSF NfL 
changes were associated with grey-matter atrophy, but not with Aβ-PET changes, 
supporting a temporal decoupling of Aβ deposition and neurodegeneration. These 
observations support NfL in both CSF and blood as an early marker of 
neurodegeneration but suggest that NfL measured in the CSF may be better suited 
for monitoring clinical trial outcomes in symptomatic AD patients.

Cardiolipin (CL) is an essential phospholipid that supports the functions of 
mitochondrial membrane transporters and oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Due 
to the high level of fatty acyl chain unsaturation, CL is prone to peroxidation 
during aging, neurodegenerative disease, stroke, and traumatic brain or spinal 
cord injury. Therefore, effective therapies that stabilize and preserve CL 
levels or enhance healthy CL fatty acyl chain remodeling are needed. In the last 
few years, great strides have been made in determining the mechanisms through 
which precursors for CL biosynthesis, such as phosphatidic acid (PA), are 
transferred from the ER to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and then to 
the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) where CL biosynthesis takes place. Many 
neurodegenerative disorders show dysfunctional mitochondrial ER contact sites 
that may perturb PA transport and CL biosynthesis. However, little is currently 
known on how neuronal mitochondria regulate the synthesis, remodeling, and 
degradation of CL. This review will focus on recent developments on the role of 
CL in neurological disorders. Importantly, due to CL species in the brain being 
more unsaturated and diverse than in other tissues, this review will also 
identify areas where more research is needed to determine a complete picture of 
brain and spinal cord CL function so that effective therapeutics can be 
developed to restore the rates of CL synthesis and remodeling in neurological 
disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Studies have shown 
that neuronal cell cycle re-entry is an abnormal change in the early stage of 
AD, and it is also one of the key reasons for mediating neuronal death. The 
mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion in treating AD may be related to the 
regulation of abnormal cell cycle. In this article, we reviewed the occurrence 
of AD neuronal cell cycle re-entry and its mediated cell death mechanism, listed 
the factors affecting neuronal cell cycle re-entry, explored the possible 
mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion in preventing and treating AD by 
regulating AD cell cycle protein, AD neuronal cell cycle re-entry influencing 
factors (β-amyloid protein and Tau protein phosphorylation level, oxidative 
stress, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), the multi-target regulation of 
neuronal cell cycle re-entry, so as to provide reference for the application and

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that 
place a huge economic and emotional burden on society. Salidroside (Sal) has 
been reported to have therapeutic effects in a variety of neurological disorders 
such as Alzheimer's disease （AD） and Parkinson's disease (PD), however no 
studies have been conducted to show whether salidroside is effective in ASD. 
Pyroptosis is involved in the pathology of a variety of neurological disorders, 
but has not been reported in ASD.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether pyroptosis is 
involved in the pathological mechanisms of ASD, and whether salidroside has an 
impact on the pathological process of ASD by regulating pyroptosis.
METHODS: We obtained a rat model of offspring ASD by prenatal intraperitoneal 
administration of valproic acid (VPA, 500 mg/kg) to pregnant rats, and we 
treated seven-day-old offspring ASD with salidroside (Sal, 30 mg/kg once daily) 
by gavage for 28 days as the salidroside treatment group. We examined the 
hippocampal state of ASD rats and the effect of salidroside on the hippocampus 
of VPA-induced ASD rats. In addition, in BV2 cells treated with LPS/Nig, we 
explored the mechanisms by which salidroside regulates neuroinflammation and 
pyroptosis in vitro.
RESULTS: In vivo, we observed VPA-induced hippocampal neuronal damage and 
activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signalling pathway in ASD rats, while 
salidroside alleviated neuronal damage in ASD rats. In vitro, we found that 
salidroside inhibited LPS/Nig-induced neuroinflammation and activation of the 
NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signalling pathway. These results suggest that the 
therapeutic effect of salidroside on hippocampal damage in ASD rats may be 
related to NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work showed that salidroside ameliorates hippocampal 
neurological damage in ASD rats by targeting NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated 
pyroptosis, providing a potential therapy drug for ASD.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are 
increasingly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Central 
to this link are mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), 
including mitochondrial DNA, ATP, and reactive oxygen species, released during 
mitochondrial stress or damage. These mtDAMPs activate inflammatory pathways, 
such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING, contributing to the progression 
of neurodegenerative diseases. This review delves into the mechanisms by which 
mtDAMPs drive neuroinflammation and discusses potential therapeutic strategies 
targeting these pathways to mitigate neurodegeneration. Additionally, it 
explores the cross-talk between mitochondria and the immune system, highlighting 
the complex interplay that exacerbates neuronal damage. Understanding the role 
of mtDAMPs could pave the way for novel treatments aimed at modulating 
neuroinflammation and slowing disease progression, ultimately improving patient 
outcome.

OBJECTIVES: Nursing home (NH) administrator perceptions regarding the utility of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying medications in NHs are important 
because many short and long-stay residents have mild AD. This study examined the 
interest of directors of nursing (DoNs) in using new AD disease-modifying 
treatments, changes in attitudes based on differences in costs to the NH, and 
characteristics (DoN and NH) associated with such changes.
DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is based on a 2022 nationally 
representative survey of 340 NH DoNs, which was drawn from a stratified random 
sample of US NHs with ≥30 beds and with a 26.6% response rate.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis to assess the awareness of new AD 
disease-modifying treatments and the support for their use. We applied logistic 
regression models to explore the associations between the interest of the DoN in 
using these new AD treatments and various characteristics.
RESULTS: Most (86%) DoNs stated that they would at least sometimes support the 
usage of a new disease-modifying medication if there were no NH costs. This 
percentage was lower if the NH costs per resident were $2000 per year (51.3%) 
and $20,000 per year (14%). NHs with moderate shares of dual-eligible residents 
were more sensitive to cost.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicated that the interest of DoNs 
in using disease-modifying treatments for dementia varies widely according to 
the cost to the NHs. The uptake of new AD medications in the NH setting should 
be monitored, and targeted efforts may be needed to mitigate inequities in 
access for less-resourced NHs.

Stressful life events and glucocorticoid (stress) hormones appear to increase 
the risk of Alzheimer's disease and hasten its progression, but the reasons for 
this remain unclear. One potential explanation is that when amyloid β (Aβ) 
pathology is accumulating in the preclinical disease stage, glucocorticoid 
receptor signalling during stressful events exacerbates cellular dysfunction 
caused by Aβ. Alternatively, Aβ may disrupt glucocorticoid receptor signalling. 
To explore these possibilities, we investigated whether the synthetic 
glucocorticoid dexamethasone and Aβ have overlapping effects on the cellular 
proteome and whether Aβ influences canonical glucocorticoid receptor function. 
Human olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells, collected from the olfactory 
mucosa of six adult donors, were treated with soluble Aβ40 or Aβ42 followed by 
dexamethasone. Proteins were quantified by mass spectrometry. After 32 h 
treatment, Aβ40 and Aβ42 both induced profound changes in innate 
immunity-related proteins. After 72 h, Aβ42 formed widespread aggregates and 
induced few proteomic changes, whereas Aβ40 remained soluble and altered 
expression of mitochondrial and innate immunity-related proteins. ONS cells 
revealed overlapping impacts of Aβ40 and dexamethasone, with 23 proteins altered 
by both treatments. For 16 proteins (including eight mitochondrial proteins) 
dexamethasone counteracted the effects of Aβ40. For example, caspase 4 and 
methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase were increased by Aβ40 and decreased 
by dexamethasone. Consistent with this finding, Aβ40 increased, but 
dexamethasone decreased, ONS cell proliferation. For seven proteins, including 
superoxide dismutase [Mn] mitochondrial, dexamethasone exacerbated the effects 
of Aβ40. For some proteins, including complement C3, the effects of 
dexamethasone differed depending on whether Aβ40 was present or absent. Neither 
Aβ species influenced glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation. Overall, 
this study revealed that glucocorticoid receptor signalling modifies the 
intracellular effects of Aß40, counteracting some effects and exacerbating 
others. It suggests that cellular mechanisms through which glucocorticoid 
receptor signalling influences Alzheimer's disease risk/progression are complex 
and determined by the balance of beneficial and detrimental glucocorticoid 
effects.

IMPORTANCE: Data from 2 phase 3 studies of gantenerumab, GRADUATE I/II, and 
their open-label extensions represent a resource to further characterize 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), including long-term sequelae.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of ARIA and risk factors and 
clinical consequences of ARIA-edema (ARIA-E).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary data collection from the GRADUATE 
I/II phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 116-week 
parallel-group studies and their open-label extensions, including PostGraduate, 
with up to 210 (mean, 125) weeks of total gantenerumab treatment were conducted 
between 2018 and 2023. The study included multicenter trials at 288 sites across 
30 countries. GRADUATE I/II enrolled 985 and 980 participants, respectively, 
with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology 
who were aged 50 to 90 years. PostGraduate enrolled 1382 participants (671 
previously randomized to gantenerumab). Data were analyzed from November 2, 
2022, to October 10, 2023.
INTERVENTIONS: GRADUATE I/II participants were randomized 1:1 to gantenerumab or 
placebo. Nine-month uptitration was used to mitigate ARIA risk.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Postbaseline safety monitoring, including brain 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and adverse events and cognitive 
assessments.
RESULTS: The safety-evaluable MRI population of GRADUATE I/II comprised 1939 
participants (mean age, 71.7 years; 1105 female [57.0%]). Severity of AD-related 
Aβ neuropathology (lower cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Aβ42, hazard ratio [HR] for 
CSF Aβ42: 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7) and comorbid cerebrovascular pathology (Fazekas 
score: HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.0; total superficial siderosis count: HR, 1.9; 95% 
CI, 1.3-2.6; total microhemorrhage count: HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5) may be 
important baseline risk factors for ARIA-E, in addition to apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) ε4 status (APOE ε4 heterozygous carrier: HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8 and 
APOE ε4 homozygous carrier: HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.2-6.7). At the group level, 
ARIA-E did not impact long-term cognitive and functional performance (relative 
difference in adjusted means for Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes was -9% 
in pooled GRADUATE analysis at week 116 and when censored at first ARIA-E). 
While taking gantenerumab, ARIA-E and ARIA-hemosiderin occurred in 24.9% (247 of 
993) and 22.9% (227 of 993) participants, respectively; first ARIA-E occurred by 
week 64 in 86.2% (213 of 247) of participants with ARIA-E. Narratives are 
provided for all serious symptomatic ARIA-E cases.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results show that in addition to APOE ε4 allele 
count, severity of Aβ neuropathology and comorbid cerebrovascular pathology may 
be relevant for clinicians prescribing anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies for early 
AD and developing individualized safety monitoring plans. Evaluation of these 
risk factors in other anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies is recommended.
