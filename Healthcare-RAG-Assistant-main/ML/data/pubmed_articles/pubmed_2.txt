INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but the mechanistic link between peripheral metabolic dysfunction and AD 
progression remains unclear. Adipose-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may 
penetrate the brain and alter lipid homeostasis, contributing to 
neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We isolated exosome-enriched EVs from subcutaneous and visceral fat of 
lean and obese individuals, followed by lipidomic profiling. An in vitro 
amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation assay using purified Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides was 
performed under lipid environments mimicking physiological and pathological 
states.
RESULTS: Obese-derived EVs exhibited distinct lipid profiles, particularly in 
lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species. Functional assays 
demonstrated that lipid identity and concentration critically influenced Aβ 
aggregation kinetics.
DISCUSSION: Our study reveals that obesity-associated EV lipids modulate Aβ 
aggregation, linking adipose metabolism to AD pathology. These findings support 
lipid-targeted strategies as potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative 
diseases.
HIGHLIGHTS: Human adipose-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from obese 
individuals exhibit distinct lipidomic profiles. EV lipids modulate amyloid-β 
(Aβ) 40 and Aβ42 aggregation in a lipid-type- and concentration-dependent 
manner. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species from obese 
EVs significantly deregulate Aβ fibrillization in vitro. EV lipid cargo links 
peripheral metabolic state to amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease.

Visual art therapy is an emerging non-pharmacological intervention that 
integrates mental health and human services to enhance cognitive functions. It 
has shown promising results in supporting cognitive performance among healthy 
elderly individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals 
with mild to moderate dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the 
limitations of current pharmacological treatments for dementia, visual art 
therapy presents an accessible, engaging alternative that fosters cognitive, 
sensory, and emotional stimulation-potentially contributing to neuroplastic 
changes in the aging brain. Here, we review recent applications of visual art 
therapy for these populations, particularly focusing on AD. The review 
highlights the significant impact of visual art therapy on cognitive function, 
summarizing the main approaches used and exploring mechanisms of cognitive 
enhancement, which may involve alterations in brain structure, neuroplasticity, 
and the promotion of sensory system neuroplasticity, particularly in audition 
and vision. It also discusses enhancements in functional connectivity within the 
default mode network. Future research should investigate optimal art therapy 
methods, scientific evaluation and quantitative analysis, explore integration 
with other non-pharmacological interventions, and pursue interdisciplinary 
investigation of art therapy mechanisms through neuroimaging. This review offers 
new insights into the empirical evidence supporting the use of visual art 
therapy for improving cognitive function in both healthy elderly individuals and 
dementia patients, explores potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying its 
cognitive benefits, and identifies current gaps and future directions for 
interdisciplinary research and clinical application, thereby fostering further 
research and application to address cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
influenced by environmental and genetic factors. It is primarily characterized 
by beta-amyloid plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and impaired 
neuronal signaling. Given the lack of a definitive cure, research has 
increasingly focused on identifying natural compounds with neuroprotective and 
therapeutic potential.
AIM: This study evaluates the effects of natural compounds (Fenchol and Gum 
Arabic) on immune modulation and neuroinflammatory markers, specifically 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a rat model of AD. By examining the effects of these 
natural products on the immune response and brain tissue pathology, this 
research aims to provide new insights into their potential therapeutic benefits 
for slowing AD progression.
METHODS: In this study, 36 adult male rats were randomly assigned to five 
groups: (1) a negative control group received standard feed and water, (2) a 
positive control group treated with aluminum chloride (17 mg/kg/day orally), (3) 
a Gum Arabic-treated group (2 ml, 10 g/100 ml orally) post-induction, (4) a 
Fenchol-treated group (2 ml, 5 mg/80 ml orally), and (5) a memantine-treated 
group (2 ml, 1.57 g/25 ml orally). After 1 month, histopathological assessments 
were performed to evaluate neuronal integrity, granule cell density, and 
beta-amyloid accumulation in the hippocampus. Additionally, serum IL-6 
concentrations were measured via ELISA to assess systemic neuroinflammatory 
responses. Data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance followed 
by least significant difference (LSD) post hoc tests.
RESULTS: Histopathological analysis revealed significant neurodegeneration in 
the positive control group, characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolation, reduced 
granule cell density, and elevated beta-amyloid levels. The Gum Arabic-treated 
group exhibited a partial neuroprotective effect, with a notable reduction in 
neurodegeneration, increased granule cell density, and a 50% decrease in amyloid 
plaques. The Fenchol-treated group demonstrated improved neuronal integrity and 
a marked reduction in beta-amyloid aggregates. The memantine-treated group 
exhibited the most substantial neuroprotective effect, significantly preserving 
granule cells and minimizing beta-amyloid deposition. Biochemical analysis 
revealed that IL-6 levels were markedly elevated in the positive control group 
(85.00 ± 3.00 ng/l) compared to the negative control (60.00 ± 2.00 ng/l). All 
treatment groups showed significant reductions in IL-6 levels. Memantine and 
combined treatments restored IL-6 levels close to normal. Fenchol and Gum Arabic 
alone reduced IL-6 levels, though to a lesser extent, indicating partial 
inflammatory effects.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that Gum Arabic and Fenchol possess 
neuroprotective properties, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents for 
AD, with efficacy comparable to that of memantine. Their ability to downregulate 
IL-6 further highlights their potential in mitigating neuroinflammation 
associated with Alzheimer's pathology. Further investigations are warranted to 
elucidate their underlying mechanisms and evaluate their potential clinical 
applications.

Cerebrovascular dysfunctions, encompassing changes in cerebrovascular 
microstructure, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, cerebrovascular reactivity, 
and cerebral blood flow (CBF), accelerate the pathological progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exercise emerges as a promising non-pharmacological 
intervention that enhances cerebrovascular repair for the treatment of AD. This 
review summarizes the pathological vascular changes in AD pathology, such as 
pericyte loss, endothelial dysfunction, and capillary fibrosis, which exacerbate 
hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and amyloidogenesis. We further discuss the contributing 
vascular factors and underlying signaling mechanisms to explore potential 
targets for AD diagnosis and therapy. Finally, we present evidence concerning 
the impact of exercise on cerebral vascular signaling and the cells involved in 
vascular plasticity. We also address the impact of various exercise patterns on 
cerebrovascular health. This work aims to uncover the potential and intervention 
effects of exercise on cerebrovascular non-malignant alterations and will 
provide exercise strategies for treating AD.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by 
the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the walls of cerebral vessels. It is 
commonly associated with cognitive decline, cerebral hemorrhage, and other 
neurological pathologies. Despite its prevalence and impact, there are currently 
no approved treatments for CAA. CAA frequently co-occurs with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), but affected patients are often excluded from anti-amyloid 
therapies due to increased risks of cerebral edema and hemorrhage, underscoring 
the urgent need for alternative and safe approaches for treating individuals 
with CAA. Over the years, various animal models have been developed to 
investigate the pathophysiology of CAA and evaluate potential treatments. Recent 
studies have demonstrated that certain repurposed drugs, originally approved for 
other conditions, show promise for treating CAA. Additionally, it has been shown 
that positive lifestyle changes may benefit vascular health, reduce amyloid 
burden and neuroinflammation, and improve cognitive resilience in individuals 
with CAA. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on CAA, its 
relationship with AD, insights from preclinical and clinical studies, and 
emerging evidence supporting the potential of drug repurposing and lifestyle 
modification in managing CAA.

Within the disordered tangles of Tau is a proline-rich region (PRR) which is 
selectively targeted by the SH3 domain of BIN1, a known genetic factor for 
Alzheimer's disease, and may hold the key to understanding the disorder and 
treatment strategies. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau is known to disrupt complex 
formation, providing researchers with an excellent preventative or remediative 
targets. This work compiles an extensive (>60 μs) collection of all-atomistic 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Tau(210-240) fragment, representing 
the majority of the P2 subdomain of the PRR, benchmarking various forcefields, 
phosphorylations, and modifications against experimental NMR chemical shifts and 
spin-spin coupling for comparison. Additionally, several simulations of the 
binding complex analyzed for their binding energies by MMGBSA calculations and 
computational alanine scanning to pinpoint the exact residues involved, and the 
disruptions caused by the phosphate group. We noted that the additional charges 
decrease salt-bridges formed by positive residues in Tau, particularly on R221, 
and negative residues in BIN1 by up to 32%, and a strong preference in Tau, 
particularly in the latter half, for contact towards the distal and n-Src loops 
instead of residues in the RT-Src loop.

Flavonoids are a diverse group of polyphenolic compounds found in plant-based 
foods and herbs, characterized by their varied hydroxylation and glycosylation 
patterns. Their complex molecular structures confer a wide range of 
pharmacological activities, including antioxidant effects through reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and Nrf2 activation, anti-inflammatory 
properties via NF-κB inhibition, anti-apoptotic effects, and modulation of ion 
channel activities. These mechanisms make flavonoids promising candidates for 
therapeutic applications across various conditions, including neurological 
disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders. 
Specifically, inflammation and ion channel dysfunction are common underlying 
factors in many diseases, positioning flavonoids as potential multi-target 
interventions. For instance, apigenin and vitexin are natural, safe alternatives 
for treating neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, offering 
efficacy with minimal side effects. This review categorizes flavonoids based on 
their structural characteristics and explores their advancements in addressing 
inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, ion channel regulation, pain relief, 
and neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, and anti-stroke. Ultimately, the review underscores the need for 
further high-quality studies to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of these 
plant-derived compounds, alongside research into optimal dosing and formulation 
strategies, highlighting their potential as multi-faceted therapeutic agents for 
neurological disorders.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments, including MCI and dementia, significantly 
heighten fall risk due to motor dysfunction and balance deficits. Although 
physical activity is essential for dementia prevention, older adults often 
struggle with balance issues, fear of falling, and reduced mobility. This study 
investigated the impact of balance training, alone or combined with cognitive 
exercises, on functional balance and cognitive performance in individuals with 
cognitive impairments.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across three electronic 
databases to identify peer-reviewed studies written in English that examined the 
effects of balance-oriented physical therapy, either alone or in combination 
with cognitive training, on individuals with cognitive or concurrent cognitive 
and balance impairments. The outcomes of interest included balance and cognitive 
function. The risk of bias was evaluated independently by two reviewers using 
the ROB-1 tool. The effectiveness of the intervention was analyzed using RevMan 
software.
RESULTS: This systematic review found that stand-alone physical exercise 
significantly improved postural stability in 15 out of 24 studies and enhanced 
cognitive function in 5 out of 25 studies. Furthermore, the integration of 
cognitive training alongside physical exercise demonstrated additional benefits 
in improving balance and cognition in 7 out of 11 studies. These findings 
suggest that such interventions may be beneficial for older adults with 
cognitive impairments, warranting further research to establish definitive 
conclusions.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review emphasizes the potential benefits of physical 
balance exercises, often combined with cognitive training, in improving balance, 
cognitive function, and certain aspects of quality of life among individuals 
with cognitive impairment.

Generative artificial intelligence is revolutionizing digital twin development, 
enabling virtual patient representations that predict health trajectories, with 
large language models (LLMs) showcasing untapped clinical forecasting potential. 
We developed the Digital Twin-Generative Pretrained Transformer (DT-GPT), 
extending LLM-based forecasting solutions to clinical trajectory prediction. 
DT-GPT leverages electronic health records without requiring data imputation or 
normalization and overcomes real-world data challenges such as missingness, 
noise, and limited sample sizes. Benchmarking on non-small cell lung cancer, 
intensive care unit, and Alzheimer's disease datasets, DT-GPT outperformed 
state-of-the-art machine learning models, reducing the scaled mean absolute 
error by 3.4%, 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. It maintained distributions and 
cross-correlations of clinical variables, and demonstrated explainability 
through a human-interpretable interface. Additionally, DT-GPT's ability to 
perform zero-shot forecasting highlights potential advantages of LLMs as 
clinical forecasting platforms, proposing a path towards digital twin 
applications in clinical trials, treatment selection, and adverse event 
mitigation.

Extracellular Tau determines the progression of Alzheimer's disease, yet 
therapeutic strategies targeting it are hindered by poor brain delivery and 
limited clearance. Here we developed a Tau-clearing cell therapy based on 
monocytes functionalized with a high-affinity Tau-specific aptamer. The aptamer 
was covalently conjugated to the surface of monocytes (derived from bone marrow 
leucocytes and cultured under monocyte-inducing conditions) via bioorthogonal 
chemistry without affecting their viability or function. Upon intravenous 
administration in mice expressing mutant and disease-relevant human Tau, the 
engineered monocytes actively crossed the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in 
Tau-rich brain regions such as the hippocampus and striatum. They efficiently 
phagocytosed extracellular Tau, leading to a significant reduction in Tau 
burden. As a result, glial activation was suppressed, neuroinflammation was 
alleviated, and neuronal and mitochondrial integrity was preserved. Long-term 
treatment improved memory and spatial learning, without inducing toxicity or 
behavioural side effects. These results demonstrate that aptamer-guided 
monocytes can achieve targeted delivery, effective clearance and sustained 
neuroprotection, offering a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in 
Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the 
leading cause of major neurocognitive disorder in older adults. Its diagnosis 
has evolved from clinical to clinico-biological criteria, integrating biomarkers 
such as beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid or specific 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Recent therapeutic advances, 
including anti-amyloid immunotherapies, highlight the need for early and 
accurate diagnosis. Clinical presentation is heterogeneous and may include 
amnestic or non-amnestic forms. Diagnosis should be suspected in patients with 
progressive cognitive decline and confirmed through neuropsychological 
assessment and biomarker testing. Blood-based biomarkers are promising but not 
yet validated for routine use. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended 
for all patients with recent cognitive decline. The role of general 
practitioners in early detection is critical. These recommendations, developed 
by the French federation of memory clinics, provide guidance on diagnosis 
stages, biomarker indications, first-line assessments, referral criteria, and 
communication of diagnosis. They aim to standardize clinical practice and 
support timely, individualized care.

OBJECTIVES: There are substantial barriers to initiate advance care planning 
(ACP) for persons with chronic-progressive disease in primary care settings. 
Some challenges may be disease-specific, such as communicating in case of 
cognitive impairment. This study assessed and compared the initiation of ACP in 
primary care with persons with dementia, Parkinson's disease, cancer, organ 
failure and stroke.
DESIGN: Longitudinal study linking data from a database of Dutch general 
practices' electronic health records with national administrative databases 
managed by Statistics Netherlands.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from general practice records of 199 034 
community-dwelling persons with chronic-progressive disease diagnosed between 
2008 and 2016.
OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence rate ratio (IRR) of recorded ACP planning 
conversations per 1000 person-years in persons with a diagnosis of dementia, 
Parkinson's disease, organ failure, cancer or stroke, compared with persons 
without the particular diagnosis. Poisson regression and competing risk analysis 
were performed, adjusted for age, gender, migration background, living 
situation, frailty index and income, also for disease subsamples.
RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, the rate of first ACP conversation for persons 
with organ failure was the lowest (IRR 0.70 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.73)). Persons with 
cancer had the highest rate (IRR 1.75 (95% CI 1.68 to 1.83)). Within the 
subsample of persons with organ failure, the subsample of persons with dementia 
and the subsample of stroke, a comorbid diagnosis of cancer increased the 
probability of ACP. Further, for those with organ failure or cancer, comorbid 
dementia decreased the probability of ACP.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the complexity of initiating ACP for persons with organ 
failure or dementia, general practitioners should prioritise offering it to them 
and their family caregivers. Policy initiatives should stimulate the 
implementation of ACP for people with chronic-progressive disease.

Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) have been identified to associate with 
various neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. Damage 
to MLVs can exacerbate the pathological progression of these diseases and 
significantly impede therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, targeted repair of the 
damaged MLVs has emerged as an innovative strategy for treating these central 
nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study, we find that inorganic Cu2-xSe 
nanoparticles, rather than conventional endogenous vascular endothelial growth 
factor-C (VEGF-C), can repair the damaged MLVs to restore their structure and 
functions. These nanoparticles not only promote the growth and development of 
lymphatic vessels but also enhance the drainage capacity of impaired MLVs, 
thereby facilitating the transport of immune cells and macromolecules through 
these vessels. Unlike the conventional repair of damaged MLVs, this is an 
instance where inorganic nanoparticles have been explored to stimulate the 
expression of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR3, thereby promoting the structural 
and functional recovery of these vessels. The enhanced drainage function of MLVs 
mediated by Cu2-xSe nanoparticles significantly alleviates the symptoms of 
pre-formed fibrils (PFFs)-induced Parkinson's disease in mice. Collectively, our 
findings demonstrate that inorganic nanoparticles can promote the growth and 
development of meningeal lymphatics like VEGF-C, providing a cost-effective and 
innovative strategy for repairing damaged MLVs to boost the therapeutic efficacy 
of CNS diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia characterized by memory 
loss, cognitive and linguistic abilities declining and self-care capabilities 
diminishment. With the aging population globally, AD poses a significant threat 
to public health. Current treatments for AD aim to alleviate symptoms and slow 
down disease progression, but due to the limited understanding of underlying 
disease mechanisms, AD is still impossible to be cured yet. In recent years, 
there has been an exponential growth in exosome-related research because of 
their excellent biocompatibility ability, loading capacity and cellular 
internalization, making exosome to be one of the hotspots and a promising 
strategy in AD therapy research. This comprehensive review systematically 
explores the potential roles of various exosome-based nanotherapeutic strategy 
in AD treatment, with a particular focus on their specific biological mechanisms 
of action. Firstly, we elaborated on the pathological mechanisms of AD formation 
as well as the mechanisms related to the formation, secretion and function of 
exosome. Additionally, we highlighted the research progress in the development 
of exosome-based nanotherapeutic strategies for AD treatment and their 
corresponding biological mechanisms. Furthermore, we delved into the challenges 
and opportunities these strategies facing in clinical application. Looking 
forward to future research directions and trends, our review aims to provide a 
more comprehensive understanding and guidance with the application of exosome in 
AD treatment. Exosome-based nanotherapeutic strategies, as a new therapeutic 
approach, have opened up new possibilities for the treatment of AD and brought 
new light to patients.

CONTEXT: A positive effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) on 
brain activity has been observed within subjects who have Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, inconsistent findings have 
been reported regarding the efficacy or ineffectiveness of an n-3 PUFA dietary 
intervention for cognitive improvement.
OBJECTIVE: To address this problem, our thorough investigation and statistical 
analysis sought to assess the impact of n-3 PUFA dietary intake on cognitive 
function among persons diagnosed with AD or MCI.
DATA SOURCES: The databases consulted included PubMed, PubMed Central Library, 
and the Cochrane Library.
DATA EXTRACTION: Nine articles reporting on the findings of randomized 
controlled trials that looked at the link between n-3 PUFA intake and cognitive 
performance-related outcomes were included in the comprehensive evaluation, with 
the meta-analysis utilizing 7 of these. Key details such as author, publication 
year, study area, research type, pathology (MCI or AD), were incorporated into 
the data extraction procedure.
DATA ANALYSIS: Evaluation of the included studies used Cochrane risk-of-bias 
instruments, a random-effects model, standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 
95% CIs.
RESULTS: Our findings have provided evidence of the effectiveness of an n-3 PUFA 
treatment in improving Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) (SMD -0.82; 95% CI: -1.57, -0.08; 
P = .000), information processing (SMD -2.90; 95% CI: -5.25, -0.56; P = .000), 
and digit span/working memory/attention aspects of cognitive functioning (SMD 
-1.89; 95% CI: -3.27, -0.51; P = .000). No evidence was found for the 
effectiveness of an n-3 PUFA treatment in improving image completion (SMD -0.07; 
95% CI: -0.50, 0.35; P = .000), picture layout (SMD -0.08; 95% CI: -0.32, 0.16; 
P = .075), block design SMD -0.15; 95% CI: -0.37, 0.03; P = .123), or arithmetic 
aspects of cognitive functioning (SMD -0.33; 95% CI: -0.61, 0.04; P = .007).
CONCLUSION: In summary, n-3 PUFAs have been found to significantly affect some 
domains of cognitive function, such as FSIQ, information processing, and digit 
span/working memory/attention in subjects with MCI. However, no significant 
effect was observed for some domains, such as picture completion, picture 
arrangement, or block design.

Assessing Cumulative, Meaningful Benefits of Disease-Modifying Therapies 
Targeting Synucleinopathies: Conference Proceedings and Roadmap for Research.

This article summarizes the Workshop on Assessing Cumulative Benefits of 
Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs) Targeting Synucleinopathies, which was held 
in New York, N.Y., on November 18 and 19, 2024. This event was hosted by a 
coalition of nonprofit organizations and brought together representatives from 
academia, industry, and patient advocacy communities to discuss the cumulative, 
meaningful benefits of DMTs for synucleinopathies; to identify priorities for 
the field; and to explore opportunities for collaboration. Synucleinopathies, 
including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system 
atrophy, are neurodegenerative conditions that share underlying pathobiology and 
have many clinical similarities, including difficulties with movement, changes 
in cognition, sleep disturbances, and autonomic symptoms. Although there are 
some available symptomatic treatments for synucleinopathies, DMTs-medications 
that address the underlying biological processes of illness-are currently under 
development and might obtain regulatory approval in the near future. However, 
many other factors contribute to whether patients will have access to these 
novel therapies. Governments, private payers, clinicians, medical professional 
specialty societies, patients, and care partners think about meaningful benefits 
differently from regulators, who focus on safety and efficacy. The workshop 
attendees discussed these factors and considered next steps for understanding 
the benefits of DMTs for synucleinopathies.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds with single Western medicines in treating 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: In this study, we searched for randomized controlled trials on the 
treatment of AD with TCM compounds published before March 2025 in Chinese and 
English databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure, VIP, and Wanfang) and conducted a meta-analysis using Stata15.0 
software.
RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were included, involving 2,035 participants 
(1,173 in the experimental group and 862 in the control group). Traditional 
Chinese herbal compounds showed good clinical efficacy and maintenance effects 
in the treatment of AD. The effective rate of TCM compounds in treating AD was 
higher than that of Western medicine (relative risk ratio = 1.19, 95% CI: 
1.04-1.37, p = 0.009). In terms of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive and Hierarchic Dementia Scale-Revised scores, TCM compounds were 
superior to Western medicine (standardized mean difference = -0.22, 95% CI: 
-0.40--0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in 
the Mini-Mental State Examination or Activities of Daily Living scores. 
Additionally, there were no significant differences in adverse reactions between 
the TCM compounds and Western medicine groups.
CONCLUSION: The present research indicates that TCM compounds could be a 
promising therapeutic option for AD, demonstrating encouraging results in terms 
of efficacy and safety, particularly regarding certain cognitive functions.

OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent 
neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The precise etiology and 
pathogenesis of PD remain unclear. Human wild-type α-synuclein has been 
implicated in PD pathogenesis. The objective of this study is to examine the 
role of α-synuclein in PD by establishing a rat model of substantia nigra 
degeneration and Motor behavioral changes through the induced overexpression of 
human α-synuclein.
METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to either the Negative control group or the 
adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) treatment group. Animals in the AAV9 
group received 2.5 μL of AAV9 expressing human wild-type α-synuclein, while 
those in the Negative control group received an equal volume of AAV9 expressing 
green fluorescent protein via stereotactic unilateral injection into the 
substantia nigra pars compacta. Behavioral assessments were conducted at 1-, 3-, 
and 8-weeks following virus administration. Tyrosine hydroxylase and human 
α-synuclein expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta were analyzed. 
Additionally, dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid levels 
in the striatum were quantified.
RESULTS: After 3 weeks of virus induction, neurodegeneration of the right 
substantia nigra was observed, with a reduction in the number of tyrosine 
hydroxylase-immunopositive neurons in the AAV9 group. By 8 weeks, substantia 
nigra neurodegeneration had further progressed, and animals in the AAV9 group 
exhibited apomorphine-induced asymmetrical rotation and altered forelimb use.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of human wild-type α-synuclein led to substantia 
nigra degeneration and Motor behavioral changes in rats, providing a viable 
model for exploring the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Limitations include 
the 8-week observation window and the absence of neuroinflammation markers.

Apathy is characterized by loss of motivation and manifests as a reduction of 
goal-directed behavior. Apathy is highly prevalent across neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), and 
is an important contributor to the disability and reduce quality of life in 
these conditions. The treatment of apathy remains challenging due to a lack of 
specific therapies, largely attributed to an incomplete understanding of its 
cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings, crucial for developing targeted 
interventions. Apathy can be mechanistically studied through effort-based 
decision-making (EBDM) paradigms, where individuals choose between low- and 
high-effort tasks for varying reward magnitudes. Anatomically, apathy has been 
associated with alterations in brain regions previously implicated in EBDM. 
Using a novel transdiagnostic study design in individuals with AD and PD, we aim 
to: (1) evaluate the independent effects of reward and effort sensitivity as a 
mechanistic link between apathy and neurodegeneration of basal ganglia-frontal 
networks and, (2) in a subset of PD patients receiving deep brain stimulation 
(DBS) surgery, determine whether electrical manipulation of subthalamic nucleus 
and/or DBS connectivity, directly alter reward and effort information processing 
and, consequently, goal-directed behavior. Understanding how 
neurodegeneration-alone or in combination with neuromodulatory 
interventions-drives apathy, is essential for guiding clinical decision-making 
and therapeutic development. Given its prevalence across neurodegenerative 
disorders, apathy provides a unique framework for investigating shared and 
disease-specific neuroanatomical, functional, and behavioral mechanisms. In this 
protocol paper, we describe the rationale and methodology of our proposed 
multimodal approach, to investigate apathy in a transdiagnostic cohort of 
individuals with AD and PD.

The promise of targeted humanized monoclonal antibody therapies to amyloid ß and 
tau protein in Alzheimer's disease from clinical trial data has not been 
realized when put to the test in real-world studies and practice. There have 
been regulatory approvals for diagnostic blood tests in China, Japan (HISCL 
Aß42/40), and the United Kingdom (UK) (PrecivityAD2). On May 16, 2025, the US 
FDA approved the Lumipulse G blood test, which utilizes the plasma 
pTau217/Aß1-42 ratio, for the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid plaques in 
symptomatic patients of 55 years or more. Biological biomarkers and targets are 
currently being evaluated in phase 1 to phase 3 clinical trials, to rapidly 
implement less invasive blood-based assays to detect tau species and 
neurofilament light (NfL). However, clinical validation of the diagnostic value 
of identifying blood biomarkers still requires support from amyloid positron 
emission tomography (PET) brain scans and/or the results of cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) analysis. This editorial aims to identify how real-world outcomes of new 
disease-modifying therapies highlight the need for diagnostic biomarkers for 
early Alzheimer's disease and the current status of biomarkers identified by 
blood plasma, CSF, and imaging.

INTRODUCTION: This research aimed to investigate the potential of Hordenine (HR) 
against Alzheimer's Disease (AD) induced by Streptozotocin (STZ) in Wistar rats 
by evaluating its impact on cognitive function, oxidative stress, inflammatory 
cytokines, and neuroprotective biomarkers in comparison to donepezil.
METHODS: The study involved five groups of Wistar rats: a control group, a group 
with STZinduced AD, and three treatment groups receiving varying doses of HR (50 
mg/kg and 75 mg/kg) and donepezil (5 mg/kg). Over 28 days, the animals underwent 
various behavioural tests to assess cognitive function, along with biochemical 
analyses to measure A+cetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress 
markers, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), and nuclear factor kappa B 
(NF-κB) levels, and histological examination. Additionally, molecular docking 
studies were performed to assess the interaction of HR with AChE.
RESULTS: STZ administration caused significant cognitive decline, oxidative 
stress, and elevated inflammatory markers. HR supplementation, particularly at 
75 mg/kg, significantly improved cognition, reduced oxidative stress, and 
decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), as well as NF-κB levels, 
while increasing Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression. Molecular 
docking studies revealed strong binding of HR to AChE, suggesting potential 
inhibitory effects.
DISCUSSION: Hordenine demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects against 
STZ-induced neurotoxicity by improving cognition and reducing oxidative stress 
and inflammation, suggesting HR's potential as an adjunct therapy for 
Alzheimer's disease, offering a protective mechanism that may complement 
existing treatments like donepezil.
CONCLUSION: The research shows that the medicinal plant HR exhibits 
neuroprotective potential against AD induced by STZ. Further research involving 
clinical trials is warranted to fully establish the efficacy and safety of HR in 
the treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, with no 
effective treatment currently available. Recently, non-pharmacological therapy, 
especially gamma frequency stimulation has shown promising therapeutic effects 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. Electric field (EF) is a non-invasive 
biophysical approach for neuronal protection. However, whether EF is beneficial 
in AD neuropathology remains unknown. In this study, we exposed the P301S 
tauopathy mouse model to EF at gamma frequency on the head. We demonstrated that 
EF treatment significantly improved the cognitive impairments in the P301S mice. 
This was accompanied by reduced tau pathologies, suppressed microglial 
activation, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the tauopathy mouse brain. 
Moreover, EF treatment induced cell-specific responses in neural cells, with 
neurons being more susceptible, followed by microglia and oligodendrocytes. EF 
also had favorable effects on synaptic protein in neurons, inflammatory response 
and complement signaling in microglia, and myelination in oligodendrocytes. This 
study provides strong evidence that EF at gamma frequency may have great 
potential to be a novel therapeutic intervention for P301S by attenuating 
neuropathology and offering neuroprotection.

BACKGROUND: Tau protein aggregates are a key pathological hallmark of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are closely associated with cognitive decline and 
neurodegeneration. It is proposed that tau aggregates faithfully propagate 
throughout the brain by self-templating their disease-associated conformation 
onto natively-folded tau monomers, thereby inducing their aggregation and 
incorporation into growing fibrils. As such, the inhibition or modulation of tau 
seeding and aggregation represents a viable therapeutic strategy for AD and 
other tauopathies.
METHODS: We have recently developed seed amplification assays (SAA) for the 
detection and amplification of small quantities of misfolded protein aggregates 
in various neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, we adapted the SAA 
technology to amplify the process of tau aggregation and seeding in AD brain 
samples. Using the Tau-SAA we screened two chemical libraries: one comprising 
over 20 suspected aggregation inhibitors and the other comprising over 200 
FDA-approved, blood-brain barrier-permeable compounds from a commercial chemical 
library. We also performed secondary in vitro assays to confirm the activity of 
selected hits as well as determining the IC50 of the most active compounds.
RESULTS: Our Tau-SAA detects the presence of tau seeds even after a 
100-million-fold dilution of the initial inoculum. Examination of 26 postmortem 
brain samples from AD and control cases confirmed that our assay is specific for 
AD brain tau seeds. Screening of 220 compounds showed that approximately 57% of 
suspected aggregation inhibitors and ~ 3% of CNS-penetrant compounds inhibited 
over 75% of AD brain-templated tau aggregation.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data suggests that Tau-SAA readily detects the 
presence of tau seeds in AD brains but not in controls, and that by amplifying 
AD brain tau seeds, the assay may serve as a valuable primary drug screening 
platform.

BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia coincides with a shrinking 
healthcare workforce, highlighting the importance of dementia prevention. 
Digital health tools are smart devices and connected equipment that improve 
health and can be used by individuals themselves, such as apps, platforms, or 
wearables. These tools can be used to empower people in the general population 
to take care of their brain health and dementia prevention. We aimed to 
exploratively investigate the intention to use and perceived satisfaction with 
MijnBreincoach, a Dutch digital tool for dementia prevention among the general 
public, and their associated variables.
METHODS: For this observational, cross-sectional study, data was gathered via 
convenience and purposive sampling using a questionnaire among cognitively 
unimpaired people and people with self-reported cognitive complaints. The 
questionnaire covered variables, including gender, age, employment situation, 
educational attainment, perceived financial scarcity, health literacy, dementia 
risk, motivation for dementia prevention-related behaviour change, digital 
proficiency, digital acceptability, and technology adoption. MijnBreincoach was 
included as a use case to assess the outcome variables ‘intention to use’ and 
‘perceived satisfaction’. Analyses included exploratory descriptives, 
correlations, and robust backward stepwise regression using Generalized Linear 
Models with 5-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: Study participants (n = 673; mean age = 60.6 ± 13.9; female = 68%; 
education (low = 26.1%; medium = 35%; high = 38.9%)) had a mean intention to use 
of 3.1 ± 3 (min = 1; max = 5) and mean perceived satisfaction of 6.4 ± 2.4 
(min = 0; max = 10). Educational attainment, digital proficiency, digital 
acceptability, technology adoption, and cues to action explain almost half (44%) 
of the variance in intention to use. For perceived satisfaction, 28.2% of the 
variance was explained by digital proficiency and technology adoption.
CONCLUSION: In general, the Dutch general public has a moderate intention to use 
and perceived satisfaction with a digital tool for dementia prevention. Yet, 
large variation in scores was observed, which provides opportunity to tailor 
support for the use of these digital tools to different target groups.

Although fatty acids support mitochondrial ATP production in most tissues, 
neurons are believed to rely exclusively on glucose for energy. Here we show 
that genetic ablation of the triglyceride and phospholipid lipase Ddhd2 impairs 
mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis in cultured neurons, despite 
increased glycolysis. This defect arises from reduced levels of long-chain 
saturated free fatty acids, particularly myristic, palmitic and stearic acids, 
normally released in an activity-dependent manner by Ddhd2. Inhibition of 
mitochondrial fatty acid import in wild-type neurons similarly reduced 
mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Saturated fatty acyl-coenzyme A 
treatment restored mitochondrial energy production in Ddhd2 knockout neurons. 
When provided in combination, these activated fatty acyl-CoA supplements also 
rescued defects in membrane trafficking, synaptic function and protein 
homeostasis. These findings uncover that neurons perform β-oxidation of 
endogenous long-chain free fatty acids to meet ATP demands and reveal a 
potential therapeutic strategy for hereditary spastic paraplegia 54 caused by 
DDHD2 mutations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the accumulation of Aβ42 peptides, which contribute to 
oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons. Garcinone 
D (GD), a bioactive xanthone derived from mangosteen, has shown promise as a 
neuroprotective agent; however, its mechanisms of action against Aβ42-induced 
neurotoxicity remain insufficiently defined. This study examined the protective 
effects of GD in Aβ42-treated neuronal cells, focusing on key molecular 
pathways. Our results demonstrate that GD significantly enhances cell viability 
and stabilizes mitochondrial function while reducing reactive oxygen species and 
apoptotic markers in Aβ42-treated cells. Additionally, GD activates key 
antioxidant pathways involving Nrf2 and HO-1, and inhibits caspase activity, 
thereby demonstrating a multifaceted approach to neuroprotection. These findings 
suggest that GD could serve as a valuable therapeutic candidate for AD by 
addressing multiple aspects of cellular damage that contribute to 
neurodegeneration. By promoting mitochondrial health while modulating oxidative 
and apoptotic pathways, GD shows potential for advancing therapeutic strategies 
in neurodegenerative disorders.

Trillions of microbes inhabit the human gut and engage in diverse biological 
processes by secreting different metabolites. These metabolites influence 
mitochondrial function and produce ROS. This gut-mitochondrial communication 
plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular homeostasis, energy production, and 
oxidative stress management, all required for optimal health. Short-chain fatty 
acids, secondary bile acids, amines, and gaseous metabolites are major gut 
metabolites that aid in governing mitochondrial processes to facilitate 
effective energy production and avoid oxidative damage. In the case of damaged 
mitochondrial function, it can alter gut flora (dysbiosis), resulting in 
inflammation and assisting a number of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, 
Alzheimer's disease, IgA nephropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal 
cancer. The gut-mitochondria axis is a multifaceted interaction that regulates a 
cell's energy homeostasis and provides novel therapeutic opportunities. 
Probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modifications, and metabolite therapies have the 
potential to restore gut-microbe balance, enhance mitochondrial function, and 
reduce oxidative stress. These measures have the potential for new treatments 
for many diseases by modulating the gut-mitochondria axis. This review surveys 
interactions among gut microbiota, mitochondrial ROS, and the gut-mitochondria 
axis, describing how such relationships affect health and disease.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
resulting in the progressive loss of motor neurons in the brain and spine. More 
than 95% of cases are pathologically characterized by the cytoplasmic 
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated transactive response 
DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Multiple mouse models with TDP-43 accumulation 
have been developed, however, whether they recapitulate molecular features of 
ALS pathology is unclear. Given the lack of curative treatment for ALS, there is 
an urgent need to identify the precise biological processes contributing to 
disease pathogenesis for the development of effective therapeutic treatments. 
Thus, in this study we employed label-based untargeted proteomics to 
characterize the ALS proteome and related biological processes in the spinal 
cord and brain of TDP-43Q331K mice, a transgenic mouse model of ALS and the 
motor cortex and the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord regions from 
humans. In humans, we observed highly overlapping responses across the four 
tissues examined, primarily related to the upregulation of immune processes and 
the downregulation of mitochondrial function. In contrast, TDP-43Q331K mice 
demonstrate a lack of enrichment for immune activation and the opposite 
regulation of mitochondrial processes. A meta-analysis of previously published 
mouse datasets identified the Ubqln2 knock-out mouse model as showing stronger 
parallels with our late-stage human ALS. Overall, this study provides in-depth 
analysis of the site-specific dysregulated proteomes and their associated 
functional processes across species. Thereby, identifying potential therapeutic 
targets while emphasizing the limitations of specific mouse models at certain 
timepoints in recapitulating ALS-related processes for future model development.

Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), represent a 
significant public health challenge due to their increasing prevalence and the 
lack of effective treatments. In this study, we explored the neuroprotective 
effects of beta-carotene, a naturally occurring carotenoid, by investigating its 
ability to inhibit or reduce apoptosis and inflammation while enhancing 
antioxidant potential in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Beta-carotene was 
extracted from Chlorella vulgaris using high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). We utilized SH-SY5Y cells, a widely employed in vitro model for studying 
neurodegenerative processes, to evaluate these therapeutic effects. A 
combination of colorimetric assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), 
and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess the impact of 
beta-carotene on enzyme activity, cytokine production, and gene expression. The 
caspase assay results demonstrated that beta-carotene effectively reduced the 
activity of pro-apoptotic caspases and downregulated the expression of 
pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax, Bak and caspases, thereby inhibiting apoptosis 
in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, beta-carotene exhibited potent antioxidant 
properties by upregulating NRF2 and superoxide dismutase (SOD), along with 
enhancing ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities.showed antiinflamatory 
effects reduce the concentrations of proinflamatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1 β and 
IFN-γ, and supress the inflamtion patway by supressing the expression of Akt, 
PIK3, STAT1 and NF-kB, Akt etc. Importantly, beta-carotene treatment led to the 
suppression of β-secretase (BACE1), γ-secretase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
activities, and the downregulation of genes involved in amyloid-beta production, 
including BACE1, and PECN1 eventualy resulted in dcerase concentration o Aβ 
peptides. These findings suggest that β-carotene could be a promising 
therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, however further investigations are 
recomended in animal models and clinical trials before incorporating 
beta-cerotene into pharmaceutical formulations for AD treatment.

Alzheimer's Disease is a condition that affects the brain and causes changes in 
behavior and memory loss while making it hard to carry out tasks properly. It's 
vital to spot the illness early, for effective treatment. MRI technology has 
advanced in detecting Alzheimer's by using machine learning and deep learning 
models. These models use neural networks to analyze brain MRI results 
automatically and identify key indicators of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, 
we used MRI data to train a CNN for diagnosing and categorizing the four stages 
of Alzheimer's disease with deep learning techniques, offering significant 
advantages in identifying patterns in medical imaging for this neurodegenerative 
condition compared to using a CNN exclusively trained for this purpose. They 
evaluated ResNet50, InceptionResNetv2 as well as a CNN specifically trained for 
their study and found that combining the models led to highly accurate results. 
The accuracy rates for the trained CNN model stood at 90.76%, InceptionResNetv2 
at 86.84%, and ResNet50 at 90.27%. In this trial run of the experiment conducted 
by combining all three models collaboratively resulted in an accuracy rate of 
94.27% compared to the accuracy rates of each model working individually.

Common Mechanism Underlying Synaptic Dysfunction Caused by Preformed 
Fibril-Induced Accumulation of α-Synuclein or Tau in a Culture Propagation 
Model.

In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins α-synuclein in 
Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like 
propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in 
neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and 
potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional 
outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous 
proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) 
neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after 
treatment with human α-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins 
accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed 
tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not 
associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological 
stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, 
suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses 
indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued 
by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the over-expression of 
full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of 
microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules 
can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that 
pff-induced accumulation of α-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can 
disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since 
endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining 
neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry 
operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with 
neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism 
underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
diseases.Significance statement The accumulation of the pathogenic proteins 
α-synuclein and tau drives prion-like trans-neuronal propagation and underlies 
distinct neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
disease. Using a synaptic culture model of protein propagation, we identified a 
shared mechanism of synaptic dysfunction caused by these otherwise distinct 
proteins. In our models, propagated α-synuclein or tau disrupt protein 
degradation pathways, leading to their accumulation. These accumulated proteins 
promote excessive microtubule assembly and sequester the key endocytic protein 
dynamin, eventually impairing synaptic vesicle endocytosis. This cascade results 
in synaptic dysfunction that could compromise neurocircuit operations critical 
for brain functions. Our clarification of these mechanistic steps will improve 
our understanding of the synaptic pathophysiology underlying diverse symptoms of 
distinct neurodegenerative diseases.

Biliverdin reductase A (BVRA), the terminal enzyme in heme catabolism, generates 
the neuroprotective and lipophilic antioxidant bilirubin. Here, we identify a 
nonenzymatic role for BVRA in redox regulation. Through phylogenetic, genetic, 
biochemical, and enzymatic assays, we found that BVRA exerts critical 
nonenzymatic antioxidant activity. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that 
BVRA physically and genetically interacts with nuclear factor erythroid-derived 
factor-like 2 (NRF2), a major transcriptional regulator of cellular redox 
signaling. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that BVRA and NRF2 coordinate 
the expression of antioxidant genes, many of which are typically dysregulated in 
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Thus, this 
noncanonical BVRA-NRF2 axis controls an essential pathway of redox signaling in 
neuroprotection. Our findings position BVRA as a dual-function integrator of 
antioxidant defense across both lipophilic and hydrophilic compartments, 
bridging these two distinct modes of redox protection in the brain.

INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) provide critical 
and often sustained support across the dementia trajectory. Despite growing 
recognition of their evolving needs, many interventions remain episodic and not 
tailored to different caregiving phases. Frameworks like the Timing It Right 
(TIR) and the Caregiver-Identified Phases of Alzheimer's Disease (CIP-AD) offer 
structured approaches to understanding how caregiver needs change over time. 
However, little is known about whether current interventions align with these 
phase-specific needs.
OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aims to (1) explore the extent to which existing 
dementia caregiving interventions address different stages of the caregiving 
journey or dementia progression; (2) summarize and characterize these 
interventions using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication 
(TIDieR) checklist; and (3) identify characteristics of the populations targeted 
by these interventions.
METHODS: Following JBI methodology and the PRISMA-ScR checklist, we will conduct 
a scoping review of randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled 
trials, and quasi-experimental studies focused on interventions for unpaid 
family caregivers of community-dwelling PWD. Studies will be included if they 
address at least one phase of the dementia trajectory and are delivered in 
community-based settings. A comprehensive search of six databases from 1995 to 
2025 will be developed and peer-reviewed using the PRESS framework. Data will be 
extracted using a standardized form and analyzed thematically.
SIGNIFICANCE: This review will map how dementia caregiving interventions address 
the evolving needs of caregivers over time and inform future development and 
implementation of phase-responsive support strategies. The findings will guide 
research, policy, and practice in creating caregiver-centered interventions that 
reflect the realities of caregiving across the dementia continuum.

IMPORTANCE: The cumulative burden of chronic vascular and neurodegenerative 
changes contributes to brain frailty, which may reduce the brain's capacity to 
recover from acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The association between brain frailty 
markers and poststroke outcomes after thrombolysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between brain frailty assessed on 
non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and functional outcome in patients with AIS treated with intravenous 
thrombolysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was a post hoc analysis of 
the Alteplase compared to Tenecteplase (AcT) trial, an investigator-led, 
registry-linked, parallel-group, open-label, randomized clinical trial that 
enrolled patients between December 10, 2019, and January 25, 2022, at 22 primary 
and comprehensive stroke centers across Canada. Participants included adults 18 
years or older diagnosed with ischemic stroke causing disabling neurological 
deficit, presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and meeting Canadian 
guidelines for thrombolysis. Markers of brain frailty (cortical and subcortical 
atrophy, white matter changes [Fazekas score, grouped as 0, 1-2, and 3-6], 
lacunes, chronic infarctions, and [on MRI] microbleeds, siderosis, and enlarged 
perivascular spaces) were retrospectively assessed while reviewers were blinded 
to outcome variables. Analyses were performed from July 24, 2024, to March 25, 
2025.
EXPOSURES: Patients underwent baseline NCCT and were randomized to receive 
intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) or tenecteplase (0.25 
mg/kg). Some patients also received posttreatment brain MRI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome 
(modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0-1) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes 
included 90-day ordinal mRS score (trichotomized as 0-2, 3-4, and 5-6), 
symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and mortality. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed in patients with available MRI scans.
RESULTS: Among the 1568 patients (median age, 74 [IQR, 63-83] years; 817 male 
[52.1%]) with interpretable NCCT findings, after correcting for multiple 
comparisons, higher total Fazekas score of 3 to 6 compared with 0 was associated 
with lower odds of a 90-day mRS score of 0 to 1 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.40 
[95% CI, 0.24-0.65]). Total Fazekas score (adjusted common OR [ACOR], 2.80 [95% 
CI, 1.88-4.16]), cortical atrophy (ACOR, 2.65 [95% CI. 1.63-4.32]), and total 
brain frailty score (ACOR, 3.15 [95% CI, 1.87-5.33]) were each associated with 
worse ordinal mRS, but were not associated with safety outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with AIS treated 
with intravenous thrombolysis, brain frailty markers-particularly white matter 
changes, cortical atrophy, and total brain frailty-were associated with worse 
outcomes. Consideration of these neuroimaging markers may better inform 
clinicians and patients about treatment expectations from thrombolytic therapy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global challenge that imposes a tremendous 
burden on society and economies. Though recently approved anti-amyloid β (Aβ) 
immunotherapies show effectiveness in clearing amyloid and slowing cognitive 
decline, the removal of cerebral Aβ can also cause serious adverse events 
(SAEs). Therefore, decreasing the detrimental effects of Aβ in the brain without 
promoting SAEs is an unmet need in AD treatment. Here, we show that deamidation 
of Asparagine 27(N27) in Aβ1-42 can significantly reduce Aβ's neurotoxicity and 
decrease selective microglial pro-inflammatory cytokine production. We also show 
that deamidation of N27 produces a pronounced decrease in Aβ's aggregation 
propensity and decreases soluble oligomer formation, suggesting a potential 
mechanism for its mitigation of Aβ's detrimental cellular effects. Modulation of 
these Aβ properties by N27 deamidation represents a proof of concept for a 
potential strategy to alter the detrimental effects of Aβ that may not require 
its removal from the brain. Our findings on reducing Aβ's toxic properties by 
N27 deamidation may provide a basis for future therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a critical window for 
intervention before Alzheimer's disease progression. This study investigated 
whether high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) 
targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) could modulate white 
matter microstructure and thereby influence cognitive function.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with MCI received 10 sessions of active HD-tDCS 
over the L-DLPFC. White matter integrity was assessed using diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) to quantify fractional anisotropy in corticospinal tracts (CSTs) 
and anterior thalamic radiations (ATR). Cognitive function was evaluated with 
the trail making test B (TMT-B), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and 
Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) at baseline and postintervention. Forty 
healthy controls provided baseline DTI data.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients with MCI showed significantly reduced fractional 
anisotropy in the bilateral CST and ATR compared with healthy controls. 
Following HD-tDCS, increases in fractional anisotropy were observed in these 
tracts. While MMSE and MoCA scores showed no significant change, TMT-B 
performance appeared to improve. Notably, increased fractional anisotropy in the 
left ATR showed an association with improved TMT-B performance (r = 0.467, 
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HD-tDCS targeting the L-DLPFC may promote 
microstructural remodeling in white matter tracts, evidenced by elevated 
fractional anisotropy within the corticospinal and anterior thalamic pathways. 
While global cognitive measures remained stable, a trend toward improved 
executive function (TMT-B) was observed, potentially associated with left ATR 
fractional anisotropy enhancement. This positions HD-tDCS as a candidate 
neuromodulatory intervention for MCI, warranting further investigation to 
confirm functional outcomes.

Structure-guided Docking of Benzene-1,3-Disulfonic Acid to the ApoE-HSPG Binding 
Site at Arginine 136 as a Christchurch-mimetic Therapeutic Strategy for 
Alzheimer Disease.

OBJECTIVES: The APOΕ3 Christchurch (APOΕ3Ch) variant, characterized by an R136S 
substitution, confers protection against Alzheimer disease (AD) by reducing 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), 
thereby limiting tau propagation. While antibody-based strategies mimicking this 
variant have shown promise, small-molecule approaches to disrupt the ApoE-HSPG 
interaction remain underexplored.
METHODS: We conducted a structure-guided molecular docking study targeting the 
ApoE HSPG-binding domain centered on Arg136, using AutoDock Vina within the 
SAMSON platform. The ligand benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid tiron, a small, anionic 
molecule with structural similarity to sulfated glycosaminoglycans, was docked 
to the cationic surface of ApoΕ3. Binding affinity, interaction pose, and 
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) were assessed. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity 
predictions were performed using the pkCSM web server.
RESULTS: Benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid exhibited strong binding to the 
Arg136-containing pocket with a top docking score of -5.93 kcal/mol and an 
estimated inhibition constant (Ki) of 44.6 µmol. The top-ranked pose revealed 
stabilizing electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with Arg136 and 
neighboring basic residues. pkCSM profiling predicted poor oral absorption and 
limited blood-brain barrier permeability, but a favorable safety profile, 
including no predicted hepatotoxicity, hERG inhibition (cardiac toxicity), or 
mutagenicity.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish the feasibility of targeting the ApoE-HSPG 
interface with small molecules and identify benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid as a 
candidate Christchurch mimetic. While pharmacokinetic limitations preclude 
systemic use, intranasal delivery or ligand optimization may overcome brain 
access barriers. This study provides a foundation for developing novel 
small-molecule therapeutics to disrupt ApoE-mediated tau pathology in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) have revolutionized Alzheimer's 
disease diagnosis and monitoring. Their pre-analytical stability requires 
scrutiny. This study assessed pre-analytical effects to inform a standardized 
sample handling protocol.
METHODS: Assessed pre-analytical variations included collection tube type, 
hemolysis, centrifugation settings, centrifugation/storage delays, tube 
transfers, and freeze-thawing (n = 15/experiment). Phosphorylated tau (pTau) 
isoforms were measured with Simoa, Lumipulse, MesoScale Discovery, and 
immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Amyloid-beta (Aβ42, Aβ40), glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL) protein were 
measured with Simoa.
RESULTS: All assessed BBM levels varied by over 10% by collection tube type. Aβ 
peptides were the most sensitive, and their levels declined >by more than 10% 
under storage and centrifugation delays, more steeply at room temperature (RT) 
compared with 2°C to 8°C. NfL and GFAP levels increased by more than 10% upon 
RT/-20°C storage. pTau isoforms demonstrated stability across most 
pre-analytical variations.
DISCUSSION: We established an evidence-based handling protocol to ensure 
reliable sample handling for neurological BBMs upon adoption in clinics, trials, 
and research.
HIGHLIGHTS: Sample handling protocols can mitigate pre-analytical effects on BBM 
results. We developed an evidence-based, expert-consensus plasma sample handling 
protocol. Primary collection tube and delays to centrifuging or freezing impact 
AD BBMs. Plasma pTau217 is highly resistant to pre-analytical sample handling 
variations. Plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 were most sensitive to pre-analytical 
variations.

INTRODUCTION: Developing effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
requires a better understanding of the molecular drivers of the disease. Our 
previous work nominated DLGAP2 as a modifier of age-related cognitive decline 
and risk for AD. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of DLGAP2 in the 
hippocampus would protect against cognitive and synaptic deficits in a 
susceptible F1 5XFAD model.
METHODS: DLGAP2 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of F1 hybrid 5XFAD and 
non-transgenic littermates using a viral approach. Cognitive function, 
electrophysiological properties, and dendritic spine morphology were assessed at 
6 and 14 months of age.
RESULTS: DLGAP2 overexpression impaired synaptic plasticity and exacerbated 
AD-related memory deficits but had minimal effect on spine structure or 
intrinsic neuronal properties.
DISCUSSION: We highlight the complex role of DLGAP2 in AD pathology. Targeted 
interventions involving postsynaptic proteins must consider potential adverse 
effects on synaptic integrity and cognitive performance, particularly in the 
context of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: DLGAP2 overexpression accelerates AD-related impairment of 
contextual fear acquisition and memory. DLGAP2 overexpression impairs synaptic 
plasticity prior to AD-related memory impairment, but not intrinsic 
excitability. Effect of DLGAP2 overexpression on thin spine density was blunted 
in AD mice from in vivo dendritic spine results that were replicated in cultured 
rodent neurons.

INTRODUCTION: NeuroAiD, also known as MLC601 or MLC901, is a Chinese herbal 
combination used worldwide for stroke treatment. It contains herbal components 
and five hewan components. MLC601 contains herbal components and hewan 
components, while MLC901 has a similar herbal composition. NeuroAiD is used to 
support neurologic recovery after stroke and to aid cognitive function in 
Alzheimer's disease. Studies show that NeuroAiD has potential in treating 
Alzheimer's disease and is beneficial in both local and global stroke models and 
in the Kortikal culture. However, there is limited bibliometric research on 
NeuroAiD, which is a method of collecting data from published articles to 
analyze developments and trends in the field of research. This research 
contributes significantly to the literature and helps develop more effective 
stroke treatment strategies.
METHODS: In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather 
data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroaid. Data were analyzed 
using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and 
bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis.
RESULTS: The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, 
factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with 
the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, 
documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, 
overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, 
thematic map, thematic evolution, topic dendogram, and world cloud.
CONCLUSIONS: The study investigates the potential of Neuroaid, a neuroprotective 
drug, for stroke prevention and cognitive function enhancement. It uses terms 
like "cognition" and "neurogenesis" to highlight its potential. While the 
study's focus may be limited, it provides valuable insights into research 
direction and potential areas of neuroaid for stroke treatment.

Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E) are a known 
complication of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapies such as lecanemab. 
ARIA-E represents vasogenic cerebral edema resulting from treatment-related 
disruption of vascular amyloid and appears on MRI as cortical or gyriform T2 
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities. Clinically, ARIA-E 
ranges from asymptomatic radiologic findings to symptomatic events such as 
headache, confusion, or seizures, making routine surveillance important during 
therapy. We present the case of a 60-year-old woman with biomarker-confirmed AD 
who developed radiographically evident ARIA-E following six biweekly infusions 
of lecanemab. Surveillance MRI revealed new cortically based and gyriform T2 
FLAIR hyperintensities in the posterior occipital and bilateral temporal lobes, 
consistent with parenchymal and sulcal edema. Notably, the patient remained 
neurologically asymptomatic throughout the episode. Lecanemab therapy was 
discontinued, and she was managed conservatively with close outpatient 
follow-up. This case highlights the importance of routine imaging during 
anti-amyloid therapy and demonstrates that conservative management may be 
appropriate in select asymptomatic cases of ARIA-E.

Hidden Contribution of Severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease to Recurrent 
Pneumonia in an Octogenarian With Prior Gastrectomy.

Yoshiwara J(1), Yamamoto N(1), Kasai K(1), Ohta R(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Community Care, Unnan City Hospital, Unnan, JPN.

We report the case of an 88-year-old man with a history of distal gastrectomy 
who developed recurrent episodes of pneumonia within short intervals despite 
appropriate antibiotic therapy. He presented with fever and increased sputum 
production only two days after discharge from a prior pneumonia admission. His 
medical history included Alzheimer's disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, type 2 
diabetes mellitus, and permanent atrial fibrillation. On admission, he was 
febrile and hypoxemic, with fine crackles on chest auscultation and new 
infiltrates on radiography and computed tomography. Despite the absence of overt 
swallowing dysfunction, the repeated recurrence prompted further evaluation. 
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed persistent Los Angeles grade C 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) despite proton pump inhibitor therapy. 
The patient also reported lying down immediately after meals, suggesting 
nocturnal and postprandial microaspiration as a key mechanism. Antibiotic 
therapy with ceftriaxone improved the pulmonary infiltrates, and he was 
discharged with reinforced reflux precautions and continued acid suppression 
therapy. Following discharge, he adhered to these lifestyle modifications and 
has not required readmission for pneumonia. This case highlights GERD as an 
underrecognized cause of recurrent pneumonia in elderly patients without obvious 
dysphagia. A comprehensive evaluation for GERD is crucial in managing 
unexplained recurrent pneumonia, particularly in patients with dementia, prior 
gastric surgery, or other aspiration risk factors.

Education and Research, S.A.S. Nagar, Punjab, India.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major neurodegenerative disorder with limited 
therapeutic medication. Despite intensive efforts, the clinical development of 
β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors has been 
hindered by off-target effects, poor brain penetration, and toxicity, which is 
often due to a lack of selectivity over BACE2. In this study, we conducted a 
comprehensive analysis of over 9,000 reported BACE1 inhibitors to identify key 
physicochemical properties and interaction fingerprints associated with 
effective binding. These criteria were used to filter a library of 1.4 million 
commercially available compounds, prioritizing candidates with better safety and 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability properties. The top-ranked molecules were 
evaluated through molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 
followed by selectivity assessments against BACE2 and additional off-targets. 
Among these, two compounds, MCULE-5138978734 and MCULE-2333131051, exhibited 
strong and stable binding to BACE1 with markedly reduced affinity for BACE2, 
suggesting improved selectivity. This integrative in silico framework 
demonstrates a rational strategy for the discovery of selective BACE1 inhibitors 
and highlights promising lead candidates for further experimental validation in 
the development of AD therapeutics.

Although the incidence of Alzheimer's disease increases with age, the number of 
effective drugs in the fight against this disease remains insufficient. In this 
regard, a new series of hydrazide-hydrazone derivative compounds (3a-3n) was 
synthesized and their structures were elucidated using spectral techniques. 
Then, all compounds were tested for their in vitro antioxidant and 
anticholinesterase activities. Compound 3i was found to have the highest 
antioxidant activity in the series with 63.750 ± 0.033 µM and 44.210 ± 0.058 µM 
SC50 values in the DPPH and ABTS methods, respectively. Compound 3i exhibited 
significantly higher inhibitory properties than the reference standard donepezil 
with IC50 values of 1.850 ± 0.013 µM and 3.680 ± 0.034 µM against AChE and BChE 
enzymes, respectively. The cytotoxicity and AChE inhibition potential of the 
compounds on the SH-SY5Y cell line were also evaluated. Compounds 3i and 3l were 
found to have the highest AChE inhibition (81.03 ± 2.05% and 83.84 ± 2.46%) in 
SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. Compound 3l also maintained cell viability at 
100 µM concentration. The most active compounds in the series were investigated 
as competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors against AChE and BChE by enzyme 
kinetic studies. Moreover, molecular docking and MD simulation studies were used 
to describe the enzyme-ligand interactions and their stability.

Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of aging-related 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and Multiple Sclerosis. It involves the activation of glial cells and the 
release of pro-inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, 
which, when chronically sustained, contribute to neuronal damage and cognitive 
decline. Recent evidence suggests that regular physical exercise exerts 
neuroprotective effects by modulating neuroinflammatory pathways and enhancing 
brain health. Exercise has been shown to regulate the activity of microglia and 
astrocytes, strengthen the blood-brain barrier, and reduce systemic and 
gut-derived inflammation-all of which are implicated in the progression of 
neurodegeneration. Additionally, exercise influences inflammasome signaling, a 
key component in the innate immune response, further mitigating 
inflammation-induced neuronal injury. This review summarizes current findings on 
the impact of physical activity on inflammation and inflammasome pathways in 
aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the therapeutic potential 
of exercise as a non-pharmacological intervention. Further research is warranted 
to optimize exercise protocols for maximal neuroprotective benefits.

BACKGROUND: Lecanemab is a disease-modifying immunotherapy for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and has been increasingly prescribed to the patients in the world. 
It has a definite therapeutic effect in slowing cognitive decline in AD 
patients, but its adverse drug reactions should not be ignored.
CASE PRESENTATION: We reported an 82-year-old Chinese AD patient who developed 
recurrent D-dimer elevation after lecanemab infusions. His D-dimer levels were 
positively correlated with activated partial thromboplastin time, C-reactive 
protein, and neutrophil percentage, but negatively correlated with platelet 
count.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated D-dimer levels may be associated with the enhanced 
phagocytic response to vascular amyloid β upon lecanemab treatment. Our report 
expands knowledge on lecanemab's adverse drug reactions, suggesting that D-dimer 
levels and potential thromboembolic events should be monitored during treatment.

FHESA: fourier decomposition and hilbert transform based EEG signal analysis for 
Alzheimer's disease detection.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurological disorder that impairs the 
cognitive and behavioral abilities of older people. Early detection and 
treatment are crucial for minimizing the progression of the disease. 
Electroencephalogram (EEG) makes it possible to investigate the brain activities 
linked to various forms of disabilities experienced by individuals with AD. 
Nevertheless, the EEG signals are non-linear and non-stationary in nature making 
it difficult to retrieve the concealed information from the EEG signals. 
Therefore, a Fourier Decomposition Method (FDM) and Hilbert Transform (HT) based 
EEG signals analysis (FHESA) method is developed in this paper for the automated 
detection of AD. The FHESA method aims to efficiently analyze the EEG data to 
identify the important brain regions vulnerable to AD, and to assess the impact 
of various EEG channels for the timely and early detection of AD. The proposed 
FHESA method is divided into three primary stages. The first stage deals with 
the decomposition of the EEG signals into a finite number of Fourier Intrinsic 
Band Functions (FIBFs). In the second stage, HT is applied to all FIBFs to 
obtain instantaneous amplitude, frequency, and phase, that are then used to 
construct feature vectors. In the last stage, various Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithms are used to classify these feature vectors for efficient AD 
detection. Two distinct data sets are employed to assess the effectiveness of 
the proposed FHESA method. The outcome demonstrates that with dataset-I and 
dataset-II, the proposed methodology can detect AD with 98% and 99% accuracy, 
respectively. The performance of the proposed FHESA method is compared to other 
state-of-the-art methods used for AD detection. The promising results show that 
the proposed FHESA method can assist neurological experts in identifying and 
utilizing EEG signals for AD detection.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 
after Alzheimer's disease. With the increase in the global aging population, the 
global prevalence of PD has soared, and the burden of global medical resources 
is increasingly heavy. Although modern medicine has progressed in treating PD, 
existing drugs still have drawbacks regarding Mechanism and efficacy, 
intensifying the urgency of developing new drugs. Researchers have favored 
natural treatments for their safety in recent years and have increasingly become 
an essential source for developing new drugs. Flavonoid O-glycoside compounds 
are one of the main active ingredients of natural products and have shown 
satisfactory efficacy in treating PD, thus becoming potential drugs for treating 
neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we systematically evaluated the 
Mechanism of several specific flavonoid O-glycoside compounds in the treatment 
of PD, conducted a relatively in-depth summary and discussion of their 
biological activities, and compared them with other flavonoid O-glycoside 
compounds. This provides a theoretical basis for further future mechanism 
research on flavonoid O-glycoside compounds. And lay the foundation and set an 
example for the development and application of natural products. This review 
indicates that flavonoid O-glycoside compounds are up-and-coming new therapeutic 
drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) and can be used in PD prevention and 
treatment strategies.

Tau hyperphosphorylation, a key neuropathological feature of tauopathies such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), also occurs physiologically during mammalian 
hibernation and is fully reversed upon arousal, offering a unique translational 
model to study tau metabolism. However, limited data exist on insoluble and 
soluble tau alterations during hibernation and on patterns of tau fragment 
concentrations in the hibernating mammalian brain. We quantified tau biomarkers 
in plasma samples from ten free-ranging brown bears (Ursus arctos), captured 
during both their active summer period and hibernation in the winter, using 
clinically validated immunoassays and immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry 
(IP-MS) techniques. We also analyzed brain tissue from ten golden Syrian 
hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) subjected to induced torpor (hibernation) versus 
euthermic (non-hibernating) states by quantifying multiple phosphorylated and 
non-phosphorylated tau peptides with an IP-MS method previously applied in human 
brain tissue. In brown bears, plasma levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 
biomarkers p-tau181 and p-tau217 significantly increased during hibernation 
compared to summer (median increases of 362% and 294% by IP-MS, respectively), 
with similar increases found with immunoassays. Additional plasma p-tau 
biomarkers associated with AD pathology, including p-tau205 and p-tau231, were 
also increased during bear hibernation. In hamster brains, p-tau217, and 
p-tau231 were similarly elevated during torpor, while tau fragments from the 
microtubule-binding region (MTBR), associated with tangle aggregation, were not 
increased. In contrast, brain tissue from n = 10 AD patients, analyzed with the 
same IP-MS method, exhibited striking increases in p-tau (~ 50,000% for 
p-tau217) and MTBR fragments (~ 20,000% for MTBR tau354-369) compared with 
n = 10 human controls. We show that hibernation-linked tau hyperphosphorylation 
involves some of the same phospho-sites altered in AD, but occurs without MTBR 
tau aggregation. This highlights hibernation as a reversible, non-pathological 
model to study tau biology and mechanisms underlying AD due to its reversibility 
and lack of tau aggregation despite hyperphosphorylation in key AD tau 
phospho-sites.

This study investigates how traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters cortical aging 
by comparing cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) in 34 brain regions 
between TBI survivors and age-matched controls. Using a cross-sectional 
retrospective design, 105 Vietnam Veterans (32 with moderate-to-severe TBI, 73 
controls) were analyzed via surface-based morphometry. Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) reduced dimensionality, and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance 
tested group differences while controlling for age, education, depression, 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and intracranial volume. Findings revealed 
divergent morphometric signatures of aging: the proportion of SA variance 
explained by the first principal component (PC1) was lower in the TBI cohort 
compared to controls, particularly in parietal and limbic regions. Conversely, 
CT variance explained by PC1 was higher in TBI compared to controls, with fewer 
factor loadings in frontal and occipital regions, suggesting differential 
structural aging patterns due to TBI. Regression analysis demonstrated a 
stronger association of SA with age in TBI (R2 = 0.619, p = 0.01), while CT 
exhibited significant negative age-related thinning in TBI-specific regions 
(R2 = 0.450, p < 0.001). Together, these results suggest that TBI survivors 
exhibit structured, yet distinct, cortical remodeling, contrasting with the more 
diffuse patterns seen in normal aging. The differentiated organization of brain 
areas based on CT and SA points to brain morphology-based biomarkers capable of 
distinguishing pathological from normative aging trajectories. These biomarkers 
hold translational potential for refining diagnostic models of brain age and 
informing targeted neuromodulation or rehabilitation strategies to support 
cognitive and functional resilience in older adults with TBI.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a key lipid transporter involved in the trafficking 
and clearance. The ε4 allele of APOE (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk 
factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), and certain lipids are closely 
linked to AD pathology. APOE may contribute to AD pathogenesis through its lipid 
transport function. Although cholesterol is a well-established cargo of APOE and 
has been associated with AD, its role as a mechanistic link between APOE and AD 
has not been demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate that 
monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1), a membrane lipid implicated in AD, is a 
preferential binder of APOE. We have previously shown that GM1 promotes amyloid 
beta (Aβ) oligomer aggregation, which is a critical step in AD pathology. Here, 
we show that APOE binds GM1 with higher affinity than cholesterol and 
facilitates greater cellular uptake of GM1-containing lipid structures in a 
cell-type-dependent manner. Furthermore, GM1 alters the secondary structure of 
APOE and enhances its interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor 
(LDLR), thereby promoting the internalization of lipid assemblies. Using 
confocal imaging and discrete molecular dynamics simulations, we show that 
membranes containing 20% GM1 form stable stripe-like clusters, consistent with 
the formation of GM1-enriched lipid rafts that may serve as physiological 
platforms for APOE:GM1 interactions. These results reveal a reciprocal 
relationship in which APOE regulates GM1 transport, while GM1 modifies APOE 
function and localization. The competition between GM1 and cholesterol for APOE 
binding may contribute to cholesterol dysregulation in APOE4 carriers. Our 
results uncover a novel mechanistic link between APOE and AD pathogenesis 
through GM1-mediated promotion of Aβ aggregation.

The pathological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) exhibit significant gender differences, with a higher proportion of female 
AD patients. Women carrying the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype face a 
markedly higher risk of developing the disease compared to men. APOE4 plays a 
crucial role in shaping these gender disparities by influencing the 
characteristic pathologies of AD. As the primary androgen, testosterone and its 
metabolites play a vital role in maintaining central nervous system homeostasis 
by interacting with steroid hormone receptors. Testosterone may mediate these 
effects through the androgen receptor (AR), participate in immune regulation, 
influence lipid metabolism, and interfere with the cholinergic system, thereby 
contributing to gender differences among APOE4 carriers. Key regulatory nodes 
include IL-17 and TGF-β. Furthermore, we synthesized clinical evidence linking 
testosterone replacement therapy to cognitive impairment, analyzed current 
research limitations and gaps in the field, and provided theoretical guidance 
for developing future targeted interventions and gender-specific therapeutic 
strategies.

Stratifying Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients via Embedded Transcriptomic Data 
and Clustering Analysis.

Antonelli L, Paragliola G, Serino L, Napoli CD, Ribino P, Granata I.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex brain disorder that causes progressive 
cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric complications, ranking among the top ten 
causes of death. Clinically, there are three stages of cognitive decline: 
dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive decline. 
Both MCI and subjective cognitive decline are recognized as risk factors for 
dementia, but most countries do not recommend specific treatments outside of 
clinical trials. A key goal of precision medicine is to improve the 
classification of pathological conditions based on molecular markers rather than 
relying solely on clinical symptoms. From this perspective, providing a clear 
and objective identification of conditions that could progress into more severe 
symptoms while distinguishing them from other types of impairments is crucial 
for improving early detection of AD. In this work, we propose a clustering-based 
molecular stratification of MCI patients by analyzing blood transcriptomic data. 
Unsupervised and supervised approaches were adopted to select features from gene 
expression data, and deep learningbased autoencoders were applied to embed the 
data into a lower-dimensional latent space. This latent representation was then 
fed into a clustering algorithm to determine the final result. The identified 
MCI patient clusters showed significant molecular, clinical, and 
pathophysiological differences. Differences were also detected by comparing MCI 
patient clusters to AD patients and control samples. These findings can lead to 
an early and precise diagnosis of progressive dementia, offering a more 
objective alternative to standard cognitive-based definitions.

ObjectiveTo preliminarily conclude the safety and efficacy of middle meningeal 
artery embolization (MMAE) with Glubran 2 in treating chronic subdural hematoma 
(CSDH).MethodsThis retrospective analysis was performed on 40 consecutive CSDH 
patients who received MMAE with Glubran 2 between 2021 and 2023. The patients 
were followed up for 3 years post-operationally. Surgical procedures included 
burr hole drainage (BHD) and MMAE, both of which were performed under local 
anesthesia. MMAE with Glubran 2 was performed through transfemoral access. 
Postoperative recurrence was defined as an increase in hematoma volume based on 
computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accompanied by 
clinical symptoms, which require further treatment within 3 years 
postoperatively.ResultsIn this study, 40 CSDH patients (34 male and six female) 
with a mean age of 68.2 ± 13.2 years were included. Of these, 38 patients 
underwent MMAE-assisted BHD. Two patients received MMAE alone. A single-branch 
embolization was performed on 20 hematomas in 18 patients, and a double-branch 
on 27 hematomas in 22 patients. At the three-year follow-up, 33 patients were 
successfully contacted, and 24 patients showed significant improvement or were 
asymptomatic after treatment. Three patients passed away owing to 
non-CSDH-related reasons. One patient developed decompensated liver cirrhosis, 
one experienced Alzheimer's disease, and four patients experiencing deteriorated 
functions were unclear but non-CSDH related as demonstrated by absorbed 
hematomas on head CT or MRI during return visits. The median follow-up time was 
35 (IQR 27-40) months, and the median mRS score was 0 (IQR 
0-0).ConclusionMMAE-assisted BHD with Glubran 2 is feasible, safe, and effective 
in treating CSDH, with no associated complications.

BACKGROUND: The cognitive decline is one of the age-associated physical 
dysfunctions and also found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The whole plants of 
Dicliptera chinensis (L.) Nees (DC) are belonged to edible materials as fresh 
vegetables, and dried DC powders as tea materials or used as folk medicines for 
clearing heat and removing toxic substance in Taiwan. However, DC extracts and 
the active compounds on anti-ageing and attenuating cognitive declines are not 
clear.
RESULTS: The dried powders of the whole DC plants are extracted with 95% ethanol 
to get DC-95EE. The DC-95EE is partitioned in sequences to get ethyl acetate 
fraction, butanol fraction (BuOH fraction), and water faction. Two flavone 
C-glycosides (vicenin II and schaftoside) are purified from the BuOH fraction. 
It is found that the pre-treatments of DC-95EE, BuOH fraction, and vicenin II 
and schaftoside show to elevate cell viabilities, reduce the 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβG) activity and intracellular reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) levels in galactose-treated SH-SY5Y neuronal cell models. 
The pre-treatments of vicenin II or schaftoside also show to lower 
ageing-associated p16 and p21 gene expressions and enhance SIRT-1 gene 
expressions in galactose-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The DC-95EE, vicenin II, and 
schaftoside show dose-dependent anti-acetylcholinesterase activities. The oral 
administrations of DC-95EE (200 mg/kg) and purified schaftoside (25 and 
50 mg/kg) daily for 7 days ameliorate cognitive declines in scopolamine-induced 
ICR mice evaluated by Morris water maze. The quantification of vicenin II and 
schaftoside, respectively, account for 2.53% and 8.17% of DC-95EE by HPLC 
quantifications, which may be active compounds in the DC-95EE for anti-ageing 
activities.
CONCLUSION: The DC-95EE exhibit anti-ageing in neuron cell models and attenuate 
cognitive declines in mice models, which may be potentials in developing 
functional foods for anti-ageing purposes and need further investigations.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence underscores the potential role of the gut 
microbiome in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but much remains to be 
clarified. This review examines current evidence linking gut microbiome 
dysbiosis to Alzheimer's disease, focusing on microbial metabolomes and their 
mechanistic role, as well as on the potential of therapeutic approaches 
targeting the gut microbiome.
METHODS: A narrative, non-systematic examination of the literature was conducted 
to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject under examination. Database 
searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science between June and 
July 2025.
RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease is linked to reduced gut microbial diversity and 
altered bacterial taxa. Gut microbiome shifts correlate with inflammation and 
may drive Alzheimer's disease progression via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. 
Microbial amyloids and bacterial products can cross both the intestinal and 
blood-brain barrier, triggering neuroinflammation and promoting amyloid and tau 
pathologies. Short-chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiome regulate 
neuroinflammation, lipid metabolism, and gene expression, impacting Alzheimer's 
disease pathology. Therapeutics targeting the gut microbiome, including 
probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, show promise in 
modulating neuroinflammation, reducing amyloid and tau pathology, and improving 
cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The gut microbiome significantly influences Alzheimer's disease 
pathogenesis, and its modulation offers potential to slow progression. However, 
further research is required to validate effective clinical interventions.

Seronegative but Cerebrospinal Fluid-positive NMDA Receptor Encephalitis in an 
Alzheimer's Dementia Patient with Good Treatment Outcome: A Case Report.

We present a rare case of elderly-onset anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptor encephalitis combined with underlying Alzheimer dementia, characterized 
by seronegativity but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibody positivity, which 
showed a significant improvement following intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 
treatment. The case highlights serial electroencephalogram (EEG) changes. We 
focus the discussion on factors contributing to favorable recovery. A 
78-year-old woman with Alzheimer's dementia and hypertension experienced rapid 
onset of further cognitive decline over 1 week, presenting with disorientation, 
irrelevant speech, and disorganized behaviors. Myoclonus of both upper limbs and 
focal seizures 10 days later which lead her into intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. Test results revealed positive anti-NMDA antibodies in CSF but 
negative in serum. Serial electroencephalograms (EEG) exhibited extreme delta 
brush activity transitioning to excess beta activity. Initial treatment with a 
5-day course of steroid pulse therapy showed limited efficacy. Subsequently, 5 
days of IVIG therapy provided marked improvement in consciousness and cognitive 
function and also normalized the EEG. This patient presented with severe 
neurological dysfunction, the need for ICU management, and presence of extreme 
delta brush EEG pattern. Generally, the prognosis was unfavorable. However, 
advanced age onset and anti-NMDA antibody positivity in CSF with seronegativity 
in serum may imply better prognosis. Thus, testing anti-NMDA receptor antibody 
in both serum and CSF is mandatory and under this complicated situation, timely 
immunotherapy may be the influencing factors of good prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Current literature presents conflicting results regarding the 
impact of neuroinflammation on Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related 
neurodegeneration. While some studies suggest that neuroinflammation potentiates 
neurodegeneration, others indicate a protective effect.
METHODS: We evaluated 145 individuals with positron emission tomography (PET) 
for amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and translocator protein (TSPO), a proxy of 
neuroinflammation, to test the hypothesis that Aβ and tau are associated with 
the dual effect of neuroinflammation on neurodegeneration across the AD 
continuum.
RESULTS: The detrimental effects of neuroinflammation on gray matter density 
occurred in two waves. The first neuroinflammation-related detrimental wave was 
associated with brain Aβ deposition, while the second was with widespread tau 
tangle pathology. Furthermore, the concomitant presence of neuroinflammation, 
Aβ, and tau was associated with faster cognitive decline over 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a model in which Aβ- and tau-associated 
neuroinflammation are related to two waves of deleterious effects on AD-related 
neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Two waves of detrimental neuroinflammation effects on brain density 
associated with Aβ or tau. Aβ associated with deleterious effect of 
neuroinflammation on brain density in early AD. Tau associated with deleterious 
effect of neuroinflammation on brain density in late AD. Interactions of Aβ, 
tau, and neuroinflammation are associated with cognitive decline.

The PResymptomatic EValuation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for 
Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT-AD) is an investigator-driven study that was 
created in 2011 and enrolled cognitively normal older adults with a family 
history of sporadic AD. Participants are deeply phenotyped and have now been 
followed annually for more than 12 years (median follow-up 8.0 years, SD 3.1). 
Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genetic, neurosensory, clinical, 
cerebrospinal fluid, and cognitive data collected until 2017 on 348 participants 
who agreed to open sharing with the neuroscience community were already 
available. We now share a new release including 6 years of additional follow-up 
cognitive data, and additional MRI follow-ups, clinical progression, new 
longitudinal behavioral and lifestyle measures (questionnaires, actigraphy), 
longitudinal AD plasma biomarkers, amyloid-beta and tau positron emission 
tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography, as well as neuroimaging analytic 
measures from all MRI modalities. We describe the PREVENT-AD study, the data 
shared with the global research community, as well as the model we created to 
sustain longitudinal follow-ups while also allowing new innovative data 
collection. HIGHLIGHTS: The PResymptomatic EValuation of Experimental or Novel 
Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT-AD) is a single-site longitudinal 
study that started in 2011 with annual follow-up data collection on individuals 
at risk of Alzheimer's disease who were all cognitively normal at enrolment. All 
387 participants were enrolled between 2011 and 2017 and 306 (79%) of these 
participants were still in the study as of December 2023. While the PREVENT-AD 
dataset was not originally planned to be shared with the global research 
community, 348 participants retrospectively consented for their data to be 
shared with researchers worldwide. The first release of data was in 2019. We now 
share a second release that includes 6 years of additional follow-up visits, 
information on clinical progression and novel cognitive, behavioral, genetic, 
plasma and neuroimaging (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography [PET], 
magnetoencephalography [MEG], and new magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] 
sequences) data. It also includes analytic outputs for neuroimaging modalities.

Alzheimer's disease: where do we stand now and what are the strategic

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease, the 
primary cause of dementia in people over 65 years old. AD is characterized by 
two molecular hallmarks, the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau and 
amyloid beta oligomers, which are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau and 
amyloid beta peptides, respectively. These hallmarks gave rise to the two main 
theories that have opened the way for available treatments, such as FDA-approved 
memantine, and Aβ (aducanumab, lecanemab) and tau immunotherapies. Tau 
immunotherapy, especially multitarget approaches, has been recently proven 
effective. However, drugs against amyloid plaques had a non-successful outcome, 
despite their contributions to AD knowledge. An innovative approach comes from 
the multitarget concept, based on bioactive molecules and nutraceuticals. 
Interestingly, the use of early detection biomarkers such as Alz-Tau®, SIMOA®, 
and the recent Lumipulse™ test, are an important support to orient AD therapies 
based on the modifications of the styles of life. This includes physical 
exercise, a healthy diet, mindfulness, and cognitive stimulation, among others. 
All of the above analyses are critical to switch the focus to the prevention of 
AD.

BACKGROUND: Agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely affects patients and 
caregivers. Brexpiprazole, a serotonin-dopamine modulator, is the potential 
treatment; however, recent trials and variations in dosing have raised questions 
about its optimal efficacy and safety.
AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole in the treatment of 
agitation associated with AD, with a focus on dose-specific outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane 
Library for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) comparing brexpiprazole with 
placebo in AD-related agitation. Primary efficacy outcomes included changes in 
the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and Clinical Global 
Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores. Safety outcomes encompassed 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and 
mortality. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model, with mean 
differences (MD) and odds ratios (OR) reported with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI).
RESULTS: Four RCTs with 1,710 participants were included. Brexpiprazole 2 mg 
significantly reduced CMAI scores (MD: -5.618; 95% CI: -7.884, -3.351; P < 
0.001) and CGI-S scores (MD: -0.513; 95% CI: -0.890, -0.135; P = 0.008) compared 
to placebo. Lower doses (0.5-1 mg) demonstrated limited efficacy. TEAEs were 
more frequent with brexpiprazole 2 mg (OR: 1.554; 95% CI: 1.045, 2.312; P = 
0.030), while SAEs (OR: 1.389; P = 0.384) and mortality (OR: 2.189; P = 0.301) 
did not significantly differ from placebo.
CONCLUSION: Brexpiprazole 2 mg is effective in reducing agitation symptoms in AD 
with an acceptable safety profile.

Polysaccharide-based nanoparticles offer significant potential for the treatment 
of neurodegenerative diseases and the modulation of inflammatory responses in 
the central nervous system. These biopolymers, when derived from natural 
sources, possess inherent immunomodulatory properties, which can be leveraged to 
regulate immune activity, positioning them as promising candidates for both 
prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, when integrated with other 
materials, polysaccharides form nanocomposites with enhanced structural, 
physicochemical, and biological properties, making them highly versatile 
platforms for drug delivery in the central nervous system. This review provides 
a comprehensive analysis of polysaccharide-based nanoparticles, focusing on 
their application in the treatment of three major neurodegenerative diseases: 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Emphasis is 
placed on optimizing these nanomaterials for targeted drug delivery and immune 
modulation, underscoring their potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in 
neurodegenerative disorders. The review also examines the structural, chemical, 
and biological characteristics of key polysaccharides, and explores their 
innovative roles in combating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

Epilepsies are a common, but heterogeneous group of brain disorders, 
characterized by an enduring predisposition to recurrent epileptic seizures. 
Recognizing epilepsies as a disease spectrum offers compelling opportunities to 
implement precision medicine in routine care. In this narrative review, we 
assess the status and development of precision epilepsy, compare its 
implementation with the advanced model of precision oncology, and discuss 
strategies to advance the implementation of precision medicine in epilepsy care. 
We aim to raise awareness about the current state-of-the-art approaches in 
precision epilepsy, emphasizing their potential to optimize epilepsy care. Rapid 
technological innovations provide the foundation to improve epilepsy research 
and management including the establishment of multi-dimensional biomarkers to 
aid disease subtyping and treatment decision. We also introduce emerging digital 
health technologies that will transform seizure monitoring and prediction. 
Advances in data science and artificial intelligence will deepen our knowledge 
of epilepsies, and may deconstruct and systematize historical, clinical, and 
descriptive concepts. Following a thorough examination of the current epilepsy 
landscape - including obstacles against precision medicine implementation and 
clinical adoption - we envision that the path toward precision epilepsy care 
lies in studies uncovering the mechanisms underlying systems-biology and 
neurophysiology-based epileptogenesis using technological innovations, such as 
genetic testing, fluid indicators, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and wearable 
devices. We review the literature based on four core pillars - biomarkers, 
digital technologies, systems medicine, and data science - to pinpoint the unmet 
need for epilepsies and thus revolutionize disease management strategies.

Alzheimer's disease is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease for which no 
effective clinical treatment currently exists. We have previously reported that 
mesenchymal stem cell.derived extracellular vesicles delay retinal degeneration 
by exerting anti-inflammatory effects though the miR-146a.nuclear receptor 
subfamily 4 group A member 3 axis; however, it remains unclear how NR4A3 drives 
inflammation. Herein, we engineered mesenchymal stem cell. derived extracellular 
vesicles overexpressing miR-146a to explore their possible neuroprotective 
effects and the underlying mechanisms in both cell and animal models of 
Alzheimer's disease. In HT22 cells co-cultured with lipopolysaccharide-induced 
RAW264.7/BV2 cells, extracellular vesicles overexpressing miR- 146a 
significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells and inhibited 
proinflammatory cytokine expression, nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, and 
caspase-3/ apoptosis regulator BAX signaling. These effects of extracellular 
vesicles overexpressing miR-146a were replicated in 5×FAD mice. In addition, 
extracellular vesicles overexpressing miR-146a inhibited the activation of 
microglia and astrocytes, reduced amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau expression, 
lowered the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus, and improved the 
cognitive function of these Alzheimer's disease model mice. Mechanistically, 
miR-146a negatively regulated the expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 
group A member 3 and suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and 
nuclear factor-κB signaling. Furthermore, NR4A3 overexpression promoted nuclear 
factor-κB and proinflammatory cytokine expression as well as nuclear factor-κB 
signaling. The upregulation of NR4A3 and the inflammatory response was reversed 
by miR-146a overexpression. Finally, NR4A3 was identified as a transcriptional 
activator of nuclear factor-κB using chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase 
chain reaction. Collectively, these findings indicate that extracellular 
vesicles overexpressing miR-146a may alleviate the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease by exerting anti-inflammatory effects via the NR4A3. nuclear factor-κB 
axis. They are thus a potential therapeutic candidate for the clinical treatment 
of neurodegenerative diseases.

Despite recent developments, the genetics and biology of Alzheimer's disease 
remain insufficiently characterized. As an important first step toward 
developing effective treatment strategies to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease 
onset, the identification of relevant genetic markers is crucial. In the present 
study, we analyzed transcriptomic and multi-omic datasets across multiple 
cohorts (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Religious Orders Study 
and Rush Memory and Aging Project, Mount Sinai Brain Bank, and Mayo Clinic 
Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Studies) using gene set enrichment analysis, 
machine learning algorithms, and polygenic risk scoring to identify gene sets 
relevant to Alzheimer's disease risk and pathological features. For prioritized 
gene sets, we performed epigenome-wide association studies to assess DNA 
methylation patterns, and used multi-omic mediation analysis to characterize the 
causal gene regulatory networks. Overall, we identified several key gene sets 
relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology-particularly, those related to immune 
system function and mitochondrial dysfunction. Upregulated pathways, including 
neutrophil degranulation and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathways, 
correlated strongly with aspects of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. By 
contrast, downregulated oxidative phosphorylation pathways further suggested 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Gene sets that contained mitochondrially located 
genes (e.g., SGK1 and LRRK1) were identified as significantly contributing to 
neurodegeneration. Moreover, genes such as CXCL1, TGFB2, and DUSP1 were 
consistently implicated in all datasets, thus emphasizing their involvement in 
immune modulation and mitochondrial function. The multimodal investigation 
outlined in the current study represents useful steps toward comprehending the 
genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease, including an expanded understanding 
of the spatial interactions of genes associated with disease susceptibility. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune modulation were pathological pathways that 
converged on Alzheimer's disease and future treatment novel options. Using the 
frameworks provided in the current comprehensive study, we present opportunities 
to explore targeted treatment strategies that may alter immune systems and 
mitochondrial function to optimize treatment outcomes for individuals at 
increased risk of or living with Alzheimer's disease.

endocrine, and immune functions. In recent years, the role of the intestinal 
flora in regulating neural function and affecting the progression of different 
neurological diseases has received increasing attention. Akkermansia muciniphila 
is a mucindegrading bacterium of the intestinal flora present in the intestinal 
mucus layer that can regulate host immunity, the intestinal barrier and 
neuroimmune homeostasis. In recent years, a growing body of literature has 
suggested that Akkermansia muciniphila may play beneficial roles in nerve injury 
and regeneration by regulating brain-gut axis signalling. This review 
comprehensively summarizes the latest research results on the role of 
Akkermansia muciniphila in neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury, 
multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms 
by which Akkermansia muciniphila regulates inflammatory cytokines, 
neurotransmitters, and shortchain fatty acids are also highlighted. Various 
Akkermansia muciniphila-based interventions, such as those involving outer 
membrane proteins, extracellular vesicles, and pasteurized Akkermansia 
muciniphila, are discussed, and their therapeutic potential in restoring 
intestinal homeostasis, alleviating neuroinflammation, and supporting neuronal 
repair is explored. Although promising results from animal models have been 
reported, significant challenges remain in translating these findings into 
clinical practice and therapeutic applications. The differences in Akkermansia 
muciniphila colonization efficiency, host responses, and intervention strategies 
in different disease states limit the results of these studies. In addition, 
Akkermansia muciniphila may exhibit different mechanisms of action in acute and 
chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and thus more targeted mechanistic studies 
are needed. Despite these limitations, Akkermansia muciniphila represents a 
novel and potent pathway for the modulation of the brain-gut axis to support 
neural repair and functional recovery. By enhancing intestinal barrier integrity 
and regulating neuroimmunity, Akkermansia muciniphila has broad prospects as a 
microbial candidate for the treatment of central nervous system diseases. Future 
research should focus on optimizing the administration method and clinical 
trials to verify its efficacy, ultimately providing new treatment options in the 
field of neural regeneration and microbial therapy.

The voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6, encoded by the sodium voltage-gated 
channel alpha subunit 8 gene, is a crucial regulator of neuronal excitability, 
with widespread expression throughout the central and peripheral nervous 
systems. Recent breakthroughs in structural biology, particularly the 
elucidation of the cryo-EM architecture of Nav1.6 at a resolution of 0.31 nm, 
have provided unprecedented insights into its molecular organization and 
functional modulation. As a key mediator of action potential initiation and 
propagation, Nav1.6 possesses unique biophysical properties, including 
persistent and resurgent sodium currents that critically influence neuronal 
firing patterns. This comprehensive review synthesizes current knowledge on the 
physiological functions and pathological roles of Nav1.6 in multiple 
neurological conditions. Key findings include the following: (1) Epilepsy 
studies reveal more than 250 sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8 
mutations with distinct genotype-phenotype correlations, where gain-of-function 
variants lead to severe epileptic encephalopathies, while loss-of-function 
variants are associated with generalized epilepsy, highlighting the potential of 
Nav1.6-selective blockers such as XEN901 and GS967. (2) In Alzheimer's disease, 
Nav1.6 mediates amyloid-β oligomer-induced neuronal hyperexcitability through 
amyloid precursor protein-dependent membrane trafficking and regulates 
beta-secretase 1 expression via nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 signaling, 
suggesting novel disease-modifying strategies. (3) Parkinson's disease research 
has demonstrated that Nav1.6 upregulation in reactive astrocytes in the globus 
pallidus contributes to motor deficits through calcium-mediated abnormalities in 
neuronal synchronization. (4) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis involves 
Nav1.6-dependent cortical hyperexcitability preceding motor neuron degeneration, 
with riluzole showing partial efficacy through sodium current modulation. (5) 
Multiple sclerosis pathophysiology features Nav1.6 redistribution in 
demyelinated axons, which drives calcium-dependent axonal injury via reverse 
Na+/Ca2+ exchange. (6) Chronic pain mechanisms involve Nav1.6 overexpression in 
dorsal root ganglia neurons, regulated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathways. (7) Traumatic brain 
injury models show that exercise-induced cognitive improvement is correlated 
with the normalization of Nav1.6-mediated excitability. Therapeutic development 
has progressed from nonselective sodium channel blockers to precision 
approaches, including state-dependent pore blockers designed using structural 
insights; allosteric modulators targeting specific conformations; gene therapy 
strategies using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and 
antisense oligonucleotides; and miRNA-based regulation of channel expression. 
Current challenges include achieving sufficient subtype selectivity, optimizing 
blood-brain barrier penetration, and developing clinically relevant biomarkers 
for patient stratification. Future directions emphasize the integration of 
advanced technologies-such as singlecell multiomics to map neuronal 
subtype-specific expression patterns, patient-derived organoids for personalized 
drug testing, and machine learning-assisted drug design-to accelerate 
translation. Large-scale collaborative efforts will be essential to validate 
therapeutic candidates and establish genotype-guided treatment protocols for 
Nav1.6-related disorders.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a decline in brain structure and 
function. Their pathology involves multiple cell death pathways, including 
ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and pyroptosis. These pathways are intricately linked 
to genes associated with metabolism, antioxidant defense, lipid metabolism, 
chronic inflammation, and nerve regeneration processes. Key regulators of 
atypical cell death pathways show aberrant N6-methyladenosine modification 
levels under pathological conditions. As the most abundant and dynamic RNA 
modification in brain tissue, N6-methyladenosine plays crucial functional roles. 
Notably, there exists an intricate interplay between N6-methyladenosine 
modifications and these cell death pathways, both of which are robustly 
associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the 
molecular mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. This paper 
reviews the correlation between N6-methyladenosine and various cell death 
patterns in neurodegenerative diseases, with emphasis on the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the interaction between N6-methyladenosine epigenetic 
regulation and ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and pyroptosis in cognitive impairment. 
N6- methyladenosine-modified ferroptosis plays an important role in 
neurodegenerative diseases. There is also a close association between 
N6-methyladenosine modification and key molecules related to cuproptosis, which 
may promote the deposition of copper in the brain. Chronic inflammation, a 
hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, is related to pyroptosis and 
N6-methyladenosine modification. It is widely thought that ferroptosis, 
cuproptosis, and pyroptosis are interconnected processes that may share a common 
pathway affecting the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and are 
related to key molecules involved in N6-methyladenosine epigenetic modification. 
This suggests a great potential for future neurodegenerative diseases treatment 
strategies regulated by N6-methyladenosine modification. N6-methyladenosine 
modification plays a dual role in nerve injury and regeneration by dynamically 
regulating processes such as ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and pyroptosis and their 
key molecules. It maintains the "death-regeneration" balance in oxidative stress 
and inflammation while selectively promoting axon regeneration through the 
modulation of methylases. This mechanism indicates a considerable therapeutic 
target for neurological disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves progressive hippocampal 
dysfunction and atrophy. Obesity, common in AD patients, is a known dementia 
risk factor. Studying their interaction is difficult in humans due to AD's slow 
progression. Experimental AD models comorbid with obesity are needed for 
translational insights. This study examined the effects of a high-carbohydrate, 
high-fat (HCHF) diet in 12-month-old TgF344-AD rats.
METHODS: Nontransgenic (nTg) and TgAD rats received CHOW or CHOW and HCHF diet 
items from 9 to 12 months of age. Hippocampal neurovascular function was 
assessed using pseudo continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL)-MRI during 
forepaw stimulation. Neuronal activity was recorded with Neuropixels probes.
RESULTS: CHOW-fed TgAD rats showed reduced hippocampal cerebral blood flow 
(CBF), CBF changes spread, and neuronal power responses to somatosensory 
stimulation; all of these deficits were improved on the HCHF diet.
DISCUSSION: This approach provides a sensitive, task-free assay of hippocampal 
neurovascular coupling. The transiently improved neurovascular and 
electrophysiological metrics in HCHF-fed TgAD rats may be a manifestation of 
metabolically dysregulated AD brain benefitting from increased metabolite 
availability.
HIGHLIGHTS: Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) -based characterization of hippocampal functional hyperemia. 
Hippocampal functional hyperemia is attenuated in symptomatic Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathology. A high-carbohydrate, high-fat (HCHF) diet transiently 
restores hippocampal functional hyperemia in symptomatic AD pathology.

Enhancing cognitive memory function using Phyllanthus emblica polysaccharides 
via modulating autophagy and reshaping the gut microbiota.

University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque buildup, Tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and gut microbiota imbalance. Natural polysaccharides have 
been shown to mitigate cognitive decline by regulating the microbiota-gut-brain 
axis and autophagy, inhibiting neuroinflammation, enhancing Aβ efflux, and 
facilitating the clearance of Tau protein. Phyllanthus emblica polysaccharides 
(PEP) exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and gut microbiota-modulating 
properties in colitis and obese mice. However, the potential of PEP in AD 
prevention remains unclear, prompting the need to investigate the underlying 
mechanisms of PEP in AD prevention. Physicochemical analysis characterized PEP 
(MW: 1.182 × 103 kDa) as a non-crystalline, heat-stable α-acidic pyran 
heteropolysaccharide composed of galactose and arabinose monosaccharides. In 
vivo results showed that PEP administration significantly alleviated cognitive 
decline by reducing neuroinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and MDA 
levels while increasing anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4 and IL-10) and 
antioxidants (SOD, catalase, and GPx) in AlCl3-treated rats. Mechanistically, 
PEP upregulated autophagy-related proteins (Atg5, Beclin1, and LC3B) and LRP1 
expression while downregulating AD-related proteins (BACE1, APP, Aβ, and 
phospho-TauSer404). Additionally, PEP treatment elevated short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs) and SCFA-producing bacteria, particularly the 
Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. In summary, PEP demonstrated preventive effects 
by exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, autophagy-inducing, AD-related 
protein-suppressing, and microbiota-modulating properties, alleviating cognitive 
impairment in rats subjected to AlCl3 treatment.

Astrocyte reactivity is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with 
reactive astrocytes traditionally subdivided into neurotoxic or neuroprotective 
phenotypes. It's crucial to transform neurotoxic reactive astrocytes to 
neuroprotective phenotypes for the treatment of AD, particularly during the 
progression of the disease. In this study, we evaluated the role of nuclear 
factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in facilitating the phenotype transformation 
of reactive astrocytes in vivo and in vitro by overexpressing Nrf2 in 
hippocampal astrocytes of 3xTg-AD mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV) 
vectors, as well as treating neurotoxic reactive astrocytes with dimethyl 
fumarate (a Nrf2 activator). We also evaluated the therapeutic effect of 
astrocyte-specific Nrf2 in 3xTg-AD mice with coexpression of Aβ and tau 
pathologies. Our findings indicate that Nrf2 could facilitate the conversion of 
neurotoxic reactive astrocytes to neuroprotective phenotypes in vivo and 
in vitro. AAV-mediated astrocyte-specific Nrf2 expression improved cognitive 
function, reduced Aβ and tau pathologies, rescued the loss of neurons and 
synapses, and ameliorated neuroinflammation in 3xTg-AD mice. These findings 
highlighted the role of Nrf2 in modulating reactive astrocyte phenotypes and 
suggested the potential for utilizing AAV to target astrocyte-specific Nrf2 as a 
promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

The molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases are not fully 
understood, but oxidative stress is known to play a central role in the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we developed a 
method to induce gradual oxidative stress in induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPSC)-derived motor neurons and cortical excitatory neurons by omitting 
antioxidants in the media, aiming to create a platform for studying oxidative 
stress-dependent neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroprotective 
effects in this platform were observed with edaravone, an approved ALS medicine, 
in iPSC-derived motor neurons, suggesting its potential for ALS drug evaluation. 
The oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage was accompanied by increased lipid 
peroxidation, and it was suppressed by ferroptosis inhibitors and an 
iron-specific chelator, suggesting that neurons died through ferroptosis. 
Furthermore, through a compound screen, a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, AY 
9944, was identified as being capable of inhibiting neuronal damage induced by 
oxidative stress. Additionally, neuroprotective activity was observed with 
7-dehydrocholesterol, an immediate precursor of cholesterol, while the efficacy 
of AY 9944 was compromised by knockout of the EBP gene, which encodes an enzyme 
involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. These findings suggest the involvement of 
ferroptosis in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and the inhibition 
of ferroptosis by modulating the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, providing 
potential insights for drug development.

Hippocampus (HPC)-associated spatial memory deficits are one of the earliest 
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current pharmacological treatments only 
alleviate the symptoms but do not prevent disease progression. The emergence of 
neuromodulation technology suggests that specific neural circuits are potential 
therapeutic targets for AD. Current studies have analyzed the medial septum 
(MS)-HPC and the HPC-lateral septum (LS) circuitries separately. A comprehensive 
understanding of their synergistic effects and overall dysregulation in AD 
remains limited. In this review, we will integrate anatomical and functional 
evidence to give an overview of the role of the MS-HPC-LS circuitry in spatial 
memory, the mechanisms of AD-related dysregulation, and therapeutic strategies 
targeting the circuitry, specially focusing on molecular interventions (receptor 
modulation) and bioengineering strategies (circuit-specific stimulation).

Neurotropin alleviates Alzheimer's disease pathology by inhibiting FUS-mediated 
Calhm2 transcription, blocking the Calhm2/EFhd2 interaction, to improve 
mitochondrial dysfunction-associated microglia polarization.

Neurotropin, a non-protein extract widely used for the treatment of neuropathic 
pain, has recently been reported to protect against ischemic brain injury, 
enhance remyelination in demyelinating diseases, and ameliorate 
neuroinflammation and memory deficits. However, its role in microglial 
polarization and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains 
poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of 
Neurotropin in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Neurotropin administration 
alleviated cognitive decline, reduced amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, suppressed 
neuroinflammation, and preserved neuronal density. Mechanistically, Neurotropin 
improved mitochondrial morphology, restored ATP production, increased 
mitochondrial DNA copy number, and reduced oxidative stress while promoting a 
shift in microglial polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype toward 
the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses 
revealed that calcium homeostasis modulator family member 2 (Calhm2) was 
markedly upregulated in 5xFAD mice, colocalized with microglia, and 
transcriptionally regulated by fused in sarcoma (FUS), while Calhm2 interacted 
with EF-hand domain containing protein D2 (EFhd2). Neurotropin suppressed 
FUS-mediated Calhm2 transcription and attenuated Calhm2-EFhd2 interaction. 
Importantly, overexpression of Calhm2 in both microglial cells and 5xFAD mice 
abolished the beneficial effects of Neurotropin, leading to exacerbated 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokine release. 
Together, these findings identify Calhm2 as a critical mediator of Neurotropin's 
neuroprotective effects and demonstrate that Neurotropin alleviates AD pathology 
by suppressing FUS-dependent Calhm2 transcription and blocking the Calhm2/EFhd2 
interaction. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of Neurotropin 
action and highlights its therapeutic potential for AD.

As part of a project aimed at the pharmacological optimization of Contilisant, 
herein we describe molecular modelling studies that led to the identification of 
MBA-159 as a new polyfunctionalized, multitarget-directed ligand and a promising 
drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We synthesized MBA-159 
and conducted comprehensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations. In in vivo studies 
MBA-159 demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetics, anti-amnesic properties and 
significantly improved non-spatial memory (contextual and recognition memory) in 
a mouse model of scopolamine-induced amnesia. Additionally, MBA-159 showed a 
tendency to increase synaptic plasticity biomarkers and reduce neuroinflammatory 
trends (assessed by qPCR), as well as cognitive enhancement in a 
senescence-accelerated prone mouse 8 model.

BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele is the strongest genetic 
risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with homozygotes accumulating a high 
burden of cerebral beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. Valiltramiprosate/ALZ-801 is a 
small-molecule potent inhibitor of Aβ-oligomer formation. The efficacy, 
safety/tolerability, and brain volume effects of oral valiltramiprosate were 
evaluated in this phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multi-center, 78-week trial in homozygotes with early symptomatic AD.
METHODS: The study enrolled eligible APOE4/4 subjects aged 50-80 years with 
Early AD (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 22-30), which included mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia, Clinical Dementia Rating-Global 
Score (CDR-G) of 0.5 or 1, who were randomized 1:1 to valiltramiprosate (265 mg 
twice/day) or placebo. The primary outcome was AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive 
Subscale (ADAS-Cog13); the key secondary outcomes were CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) 
and Amsterdam-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and a secondary 
outcome was Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). The main imaging outcome 
was hippocampal volume on MRI; diffusion tensor imaging (MRI-DTI) assessed 
microstructural tissue integrity. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) 
were monitored with MRIs every 26 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 325 participants enrolled and received study drug. At 78 
weeks, the overall efficacy population did not show significant effects on 
ADAS-Cog13 or other clinical outcomes compared with placebo (ADAS-Cog13: 11% 
slowing; p = 0.607, N = 320), but showed significant slowing of hippocampal 
atrophy (18%, p = 0.017, N = 290). Prespecified analyses by disease severity 
(stratification variable) showed no significant clinical effects in mild AD 
(MMSE ≤26, N = 195). The prespecified MCI group (MMSE >26, N = 125) showed 
nominally significant positive effects on ADAS-Cog13 (52%, nominal p = 0.041) 
and DAD (96%, nominal p = 0.016), positive trend on CDR-SB (102%, nominal 
p = 0.053), with significant hippocampal atrophy slowing (26%, p = 0.004), and 
positive grey/white matter effects on MRI-DTI. In the MCI group, positive 
ADAS-Cog13 drug effects showed significant subject-level correlations with 
positive effects on imaging outcomes. The most common adverse events were 
nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite (more than double placebo rate), with 
no increased risk of brain edema or microhemorrhages.
CONCLUSIONS: The APOE4/4 Early AD population did not show significant clinical 
efficacy at 78 weeks but showed significant brain atrophy slowing. Prespecified 
analyses at the MCI stage showed nominally significant slowing of clinical 
decline with significant hippocampal atrophy slowing. Oral valiltramiprosate may 
provide a favorable benefit-risk profile and simple treatment paradigm for 
homozygotes with MCI. These results will inform the design of future MCI trials.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of action of Tiaogeng decoction (, TG) in 
alleviating oxidative stress damage in the hippocampus of a mouse model of 
cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) transgenic female mice 
were randomly divided into model, estradiol valerate, low-, medium-, and 
high-dose TG groups, female C57 mice were used as the control group (n = 
12/group). After 12 weeks of treatment, the behavior of mice was tested with the 
Morris water maze, and brain tissue samples were collected, and changes in 
hippocampal neurons were observed using electron microscopy. The deposition of 
beta-amyloid protein (Aβ) amyloid plaques in the hippocampus was determined by 
light microscopy. Aβ1-42 protein levels were detected through 
immunofluorescence. Oxidative stress indicators in the hippocampus were detected 
by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of nuclear 
factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), 
phospho-JNK (p-JNK), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-9 
were detected by Western blot. Hippocampal cell apoptosis was detected using the 
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end Labeling.
RESULTS: TG improved the cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice, as judged by 
improvements in several indices from the Morris water maze test. TG increased 
Nrf2, superoxide dismutase, and heme oxygenase-1 protein expression and reduced 
malondialdelyde and reactive oxygen species expression. TG also inhibited the 
expression of JNK proteins, upregulated the expression of Bcl-2, and 
downregulated the expression of caspase-9, reducing cell apoptosis. TG decreased 
the percentage of the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 area positive for Aβ1-42, 
reducing mitochondrial damage caused by oxidative stress and Aβ protein 
deposition.
CONCLUSIONS: TG may improve memory ability while reducing oxidative stress and 
apoptosis. It also reduces Aβ protein deposition in the hippocampus, protecting 
the central nervous system and improving memory function. TG may reduce the risk 
of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia or amnesia, 
characterized primarily by loss of acetylcholine (ACh), due to increased 
activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), both 
of which accelerate ACh degradation, and exacerbate cholinergic dysfunction. In 
this regard, the synthetic methyl-substituted monocarbonyl curcumin derivatives 
(BL1-BL3) were analyzed for AChE and BChE inhibition, followed by molecular 
docking studies. Scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was used to induce amnesia in mice. The 
results of BL1-BL3 demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect especially 
against AChE compared to BChE enzymes, with IC50 of 128.4, 118.4, 170.9 μg/mL 
against AChE and 334.3, 1168, 288.2 μg/mL against BChE, respectively. These 
compounds exhibited strong binding affinities to both target proteins in docking 
studies. Scopolamine administration induced significant memory deficits in mice, 
that was significantly (P < 0.001) mitigated by pretreatment with BL1-BL3 in the 
Y-maze test at both 7.5 and 15 mg/kg doses by restoring spontaneous alternation 
performance (SAP). In the novel object recognition test (NORT), a prominent 
(P < 0.001) improvement in memory retention was seen during the test phase, and 
enhanced the discrimination index (DI) at both tested doses. Biochemical 
analyses of hippocampal tissue further supported the behavioral data. Treatment 
with BL1-BL3 effectively decreases AChE and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while 
increasing catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Overall, BL2 
was found to be most significant. In short, BL1-BL3 emerged as potential 
therapeutic agents for AD due to significant effects in vitro and in vivo 
experimental models, and are also equally supported by in silico studies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually worsening neurodegenerative 
condition with limited treatment options, highlighting the need for novel 
therapies. Astrocytes play key roles in AD pathogenesis. Natural products show 
promise for treating AD through modulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology, 
inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and protecting cellular 
organelles. Preclinical evidence supports their efficacy in targeting 
astrocyte-related mechanisms, enhancing cognition, and reducing neuronal damage.
PURPOSE: Systematically summarize and evaluate the medicinal benefits of 
plant-derived natural products in modulating astrocyte-mediated processes to 
attenuate AD progression.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed in PubMed and Web of 
Science, utilizing targeted keywords such as "natural products", "active 
compounds", "Alzheimer's disease", and "astrocytes". The review primarily 
focused on studies published between 2013 and 2024, with the selected literature 
systematically categorized and analyzed.
RESULTS: This review highlights the medicinal benefits of plant-derived natural 
products, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, and terpenes in targeting 
astrocyte morphology and function to combat AD. These bioactive compounds 
modulate key pathological processes, including neuroinflammation, oxidative 
stress, Aβ metabolism, tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
ER stress, outlining pathways to alleviate AD through astrocytic effects. The 
review also summarizes clinical progress and major challenges in translating 
these compounds, such as variability, low bioavailability, and delivery 
limitations.
CONCLUSION: This study addresses a critical gap by systematically elucidating 
the relationship between astrocytes and AD, and therapeutic potential of 
plant-derived natural products. It aims to expand treatment options for patients 
and advance the development of therapeutic strategies in the field of AD 
management.

INTRODUCTION: Hypertension management is critically important to reduce the risk 
of conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. The degree to 
which older adults with hypertension and MCI engage in outpatient ambulatory 
care for hypertension management is unclear.
METHODS: Among older adults with hypertension in the Rush Alzheimer's Disease 
Center (RADC) cohorts (2011 to 2019), we used repeated measures negative 
binomial regression to evaluate the association between cognitive status (MCI vs 
no cognitive impairment [NCI]) and number of annual outpatient clinic visits for 
hypertension evaluation and management (E&M) (primary outcome).
RESULTS: MCI (n = 1013 person-years) was associated with 8% fewer outpatient 
visits for hypertension versus older adults with NCI (n = 4373 person-years) 
(relative incidence ratio [RIR] 0.92, p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION: Despite the known adverse cognitive effects of hypertension, older 
adults with MCI may be less likely to engage in outpatient hypertension 
management.
HIGHLIGHTS: Fewer outpatient hypertension visits among adults with MCI versus 
NCI. Fewer primary care hypertension visits among adults with MCI versus without 
MCI. Need for interventions to engage adults with hypertension and MCI in 
outpatient care.

INTRODUCTION: Despite having few vascular risk factors, people with Down 
syndrome (DS) have MRI evidence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and 
neuroinflammation that worsens with Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity. We 
investigated whether markers of CVD and inflammation are associated with 
AD-related diagnostic progression in people with DS.
METHODS: We included 149 participants (mean age [SD] = 44.6 [9]) from the 
Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome who had two (n = 24) or three 
follow-up visits (n = 125). We derived white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume 
and plasma biomarker (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], amyloid beta 
[Aβ]42/Aβ40, hyperphosphorylated tau-217 [p-tau217], and neurofilament light 
[NfL]) concentrations at baseline and examined their association with 
progression in clinical diagnosis.
RESULTS: Higher baseline WMH volume and higher GFAP were associated with a 
greater likelihood of diagnostic progression. Combining WMH and GFAP with 
p-tau217 improved clinical conversion classification accuracy over AD biomarkers 
alone. Among individuals with evidence of amyloidosis, both WMH and GFAP were 
associated with clinical progression.
DISCUSSION: In DS, markers of CVD and inflammation are independently and 
synergistically associated with clinical AD progression.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher baseline white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and plasma 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentration were associated with a 
higher likelihood of progressing from cognitively stable to either mild 
cognitive impairment or clinical Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome. WMH 
volume and GFAP concentration discriminated between those who progressed and 
those who did not. Models including the independent and interactive effects of 
WMH and GFAP more accurately discriminated between participants who progressed 
diagnostically from those who did not. Individuals with evidence of amyloid 
pathology were more likely to progress if they also had elevated WMH or GFAP.

Recent progress in antibody-based immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
brings a sense of cautious optimism after years of setbacks. However, these 
approaches remain constrained by suboptimal pharmacodynamics, modest clinical 
benefits, and pro-inflammatory adverse effects. Here, we develop a 
β-secretase-responsive immunotherapeutic agent (ATExo-cL-aA) that 
synergistically targets amyloid-β (Aβ) and neuroinflammatory response, achieving 
heightened efficacy while reducing the side effects associated with conventional 
antibody therapies. After intranasal administration, ATExo-cL-aA actively 
migrates to AD brains. Upon cleavage by overexpressed β-secretase, ATExo-cL-aA 
releases aducanumab antibody (aA) and exosomes derived from Aβ antigen-specific 
Tregs (ATExo), which jointly manage Aβ and inflammatory microglia, thereby 
synergistically eradicating Aβ and reducing pro-inflammatory responses. In AD 
mouse models, ATExo-cL-aA demonstrates efficient brain accumulation, robust Aβ 
removal, microglial normalization, neuroinflammation attenuation, and synaptic 
preservation, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function. These findings 
highlight ATExo-cL-aA as next-generation immunotherapeutics that transcend the 
limitations of conventional antibody-based treatments for AD.

The global rise in life expectancy has been accompanied by a growing prevalence 
of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These complex 
disorders arise from multiple pathogenic factors and biological pathways, 
necessitating the development of multi-target therapeutic strategies. D2AAK1, 
discovered by our group, has emerged as a promising candidate due to its 
cytoprotective, antioxidant, and procognitive properties. This study aimed to 
further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the action of D2AAK1 and its 
derivatives, with a focus on their potential for neuroprotection and cognitive 
enhancement. The effect of D2AAK1 on cell viability was evaluated under normal 
conditions and during H2O2-induced oxidative stress using the resazurin assay. 
p38 MAPK activity was measured through cell-based ELISA. mRNA expression was 
analyzed using a two-step quantitative PCR method, and enzymatic effects were 
assessed via photometric, fluorescence, and luminescence techniques. Behavioral 
studies in murine models were performed to investigate the influence of the 
compounds on memory processes. It was found that D2AAK1 and its derivatives 
significantly enhanced cell viability, with some derivatives exhibiting greater 
potency than D2AAK1. In vivo, one derivative notably improved memory performance 
and reversed scopolamine-induced memory impairment in the novel object 
recognition test in male Swiss mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that D2AAK1 
increased the expression of cytoprotective proteins such as Bcl-2 and HO-1, 
while concurrently reducing the expression and activity of pro-apoptotic 
factors, including caspase-3, p38 MAPK, and MAO-B. These dual actions culminated 
in enhanced cellular resilience and viability, translating into improved 
cognitive outcomes. The findings suggest that D2AAK1 and its derivatives, 
through their multi-factor mechanism of action, hold promise as therapeutic 
agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and accounts for 
approximately 60-80% of total dementia patients. Currently, accurate diagnosis 
for AD relies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling or a positron emission 
tomography (PET) scan, methods that cannot be done in primary care centers where 
most people go with cognitive complaints. This Limitation calls for the urgent 
need to develop blood-related diagnostic tests that could facilitate early 
detection and enable timely treatment. Recent CSF proteomic research categorized 
AD into five molecular subtypes with discrete Genetic risk profiles. Subtypes 
1-3, namely neuronal hyperplasticity, innate immune activation, and RNA 
dysregulation, were characterized by more classical AD-related changes, like 
accumulation of amyloid/tau and synaptic and immune dysfunction, respectively. 
On the contrary, non-traditional AD mechanisms in subtypes 4-5 were choroid 
plexus (CP) dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, emphasizing 
clearance deficits in association with brain barrier dysfunction. The unchanged 
tau levels later may be explained by an alternate disease mechanism (clearance 
dysfunction). These subtypes included BBB and CP dysfunction. Biomarker 
identification based on the mechanism of disease progression would increase the 
precision of diagnoses, allowing for tailored interventions and aiding in the 
creation of novel therapies for subtypes that might not react favorably to 
conventional amyloid/tau-targeting strategies. Finding biomarkers specific to 
each subtype would aid in patient classification, resulting in more 
individualized therapy as opposed to a "one-size-fits-all" strategy. The present 
review emphasized the importance of identifying blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) 
related to brain barrier dysfunction from CSF studies and personalized treatment 
strategies to streamline the diagnostic workup, and may be utilized in standard 
clinical practice for the early detection of AD.

The Hippo signaling pathway is well-known for its regulation of organ size, cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration and differentiation. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that Hippo signaling also plays important roles in the nervous 
system, being involved in neuroinflammation, neuronal differentiation, and 
neuronal death and degeneration. As such, dysregulation of Hippo signaling, 
particularly of its core kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, has begun to attract 
attention in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Here, we discuss the 
therapeutic potential of targeting the Hippo pathway in AD by providing an 
overview of Hippo signaling with regards to its function in the nervous system, 
evidence for its dysregulation in AD patients and models, and recent studies 
involving genetic or pharmacological modulation of this pathway in AD.

BACKGROUND: End-of-life communication as part of advance care planning (ACP) 
aims to support older people to reflect on their values, needs, and wishes 
regarding the end of life. Previous studies have provided an understanding of 
the important aspects ("fundamentals") of end-of-life conversations with older 
people from the perspective of nursing staff. Developing further understanding 
of the experiences and needs of older people and their family caregivers will 
help identify gaps in communication, guide nursing staff in providing successful 
ACP, and ultimately enhance person-centered care. We aimed to explore the 
experiences of older people and their family caregivers in home, nursing home 
and hospital settings regarding the fundamentals of end-of-life communication as 
part of ACP by nursing staff.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were performed with older people and their 
family caregivers about their experiences, opinions, and preferences before, 
during, and after recent formal end-of-life conversations. Data were analyzed 
thematically.
RESULTS: Eight older people and four of their family caregivers participated in 
three dyadic and six individual interviews between June 2023 and May 2024. 
Overall, participants felt it was difficult to describe and evaluate their 
experiences with the end-of-life conversations because they initially had no 
specific expectations about end-of-life conversations and approached them with 
an open mind. Three overall themes were composed comprising 11 fundamentals of 
end-of-life communication: "Navigating conversational phases: probing and 
reflecting" (e.g., readiness), "Fostering recognition and relational safety: 
acknowledging the older person" (e.g., feeling at ease, feeling seen while 
nursing staff attune to the older person, feeling a human connection), and 
"Engaging with family caregivers: valuing their role and well-being" (e.g., 
considering their well-being).
CONCLUSION: Older people and their family caregivers prioritize feeling 
comfortable in natural and humane end-of-life conversations. They want to be 
seen, heard, and acknowledged as individuals with backgrounds, values, and 
needs, not just as patients with a disease. Nursing staff should be aware of the 
expectations of an older person and family caregiver in end-of-life 
communication and adjust their approach accordingly. The results of this study 
can help in developing effective strategies to ensure that end-of-life 
communication is tailored to the unique needs of older people and their family 
caregivers, fostering an informed approach.

BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated 
efficacy in alleviating cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). Although animal studies suggest rTMS may enhance 
glymphatic system efficiency and reduce amyloid deposits, its impact on human 
glymphatic activity remains uncertain.
METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated the 
effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a novel rTMS technique, 
on cognitive function and glymphatic system activity using diffusion tensor 
image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) in 52 participants with 
amnestic MCI or very mild AD. Participants underwent 10 sessions of iTBS 
targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over two weeks. Cognitive and 
glymphatic assessments were conducted at baseline, week 2, and week 6. Of the 52 
participants, 28 received active iTBS, while 24 received sham stimulation. After 
the first two weeks, the sham group transitioned to active iTBS.
RESULTS: Significant cognitive improvements were observed at week 6 in the iTBS 
group, indicating delayed cognitive enhancement, though no immediate changes in 
cognition or glymphatic system activity (measured by the ALPS index) were 
observed. No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that iTBS can produce delayed cognitive 
enhancement in individuals with amnestic MCI and very mild AD, while the impact 
on the glymphatic system remains uncertain and requires further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a self-perceived cognitive 
complaint in the absence of objective impairment, representing an at-risk state 
along the continuum of cognitive aging. High-frequency repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(L-DLPFC) has shown cognitive benefits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its 
effects on cognitive functions in SCD remain largely unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of 10-Hz rTMS over the L-DLPFC in individuals 
with SCD on cognitive functions and long-term potentiation (LTP)-like 
plasticity, indexed by changes in motor evoked potential (MEP) following 
intermittent theta burst stimulation, and examine the relationship between brain 
plasticity and cognitive outcomes.
METHODS: In this randomized, sham-controlled trial, 42 individuals with SCD 
received 20 sessions of either active or sham 10-Hz rTMS (n = 21 per group) over 
four weeks. The primary outcome was delayed episodic memory, evaluated using the 
Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version (AVLT-H). Secondary outcomes 
included additional cognitive measures and MEP amplitudes at baseline and at 5 
(T5), 10 (T10), and 30 (T30) minutes post-intervention.
RESULTS: The rTMS group exhibited significant improvements in both delayed 
episodic memory (AVLT-N5) and MEP amplitudes at T5 and T10 following the 
intervention, whereas such changes were not observed in the sham group. 
Moreover, increased MEP amplitude at T10 was positively correlated with improved 
AVLT-N5 performance.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence for enhanced delayed 
episodic memory and LTP-like plasticity in individuals with SCD following 10-Hz 
rTMS over the L-DLPFC, suggesting a potential role of LTP-like plasticity in 
elucidating the neurophysiological correlates of cognitive improvements for SCD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study design and analysis plan were preregistered on 
September 7th, 2023 at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR2300075517).

Background/Objectives: Cinnamon leaves, an important source of the functional 
compound cinnamaldehyde (CA), have been shown to be effective in improving type 
II diabetes and Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats following the incorporation of 
cinnamon leaf extract into a nanoemulsion. However, the effect of a cinnamon 
leaf extract nanoemulsion (CLEN) on improving Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most 
prevalent type of dementia, remains unexplored. The objectives of this study 
were to determine functional compounds in cinnamon leaves by UPLC-MS/MS, 
followed by the preparation of a nanoemulsion and its byproducts to study their 
effects on AD and PD in rats. Methods: Oven-dried (60 °C for 2 h) cinnamon leaf 
powder and hydrosol, obtained by steam distillation of cinnamon leaf powder, 
were stored at 4 °C. After determination of basic composition (crude protein, 
crude fat, carbohydrate, moisture and ash) of cinnamon leaf powder, it was 
extracted with 80% ethanol with sonication at 60 °C for 2 h and analyzed for 
bioactive compounds by UPLC-MS/MS. Then, the CLEN was prepared by mixing 
cinnamon leaf extract rich in CA with lecithin, soybean oil, tween 80 and 
ethanol in an optimal ratio, followed by evaporation to form thin-film and 
redissolving in deionized water. For characterization, mean particle size, 
polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and 
surface morphology were determined. Animal experiments were done by dividing 90 
male rats into 10 groups (n = 9), with groups 2-8 being subjected to 
mini-osmotic pump implantation surgery in brain to infuse Amyloid-beta 40 (Aβ40) 
solution in groups 2-8 for induction of AD, while groups 9 and 10 were pre-fed 
respectively with cinnamon powder in water (0.5 g/10 mL) and in hydrosol for 4 
weeks, followed by induction of AD as shown above. Different treatments for a 
period of 4 weeks included groups 1-9, with group 1 (control) and group 2 
feeding with sterilized water, while groups 3, 4 and 5 were fed respectively 
with high (90 mg/kg), medium (60 mg/kg) and low (30 mg/kg) doses of cinnamon 
leaf extracts, groups 6, 7 and 8 fed respectively with high (90 mg/kg), medium 
(60 mg/kg) and low (30 mg/kg) doses of nanoemulsions, groups 9 and 10 fed 
respectively with 10 mL/kg of cinnamon powder in water and hydrosol (0.5 g/10 
mL). Morris water maze test was conducted to determine short-term memory, 
long-term memory and space probing of rats. After sacrificing of rats, brain and 
liver tissues were collected for determination of Aβ40, BACE1 and 8-oxodG in 
hippocampi, and AchE and malondialdehyde (MDA) in cortices, antioxidant enzymes 
(SOD, CAT, GSH-Px) and MDA in both cortices and livers, and dopamine in brain 
striata by using commercial kits. Results: The results showed that the highest 
level of CA (18,250.7 μg/g) was in the cinnamon leaf powder. The CLEN was 
prepared successfully, with an average particle size of 17.1 nm, a 
polydispersity index of 0.236, a zeta potential of -42.68 mV, and high stability 
over a 90-day storage period at 4 °C. The Morris water maze test revealed that 
the CLEN treatment was the most effective in improving short-term memory, 
long-term memory, and spatial probe test results in AD rats, followed by the 
cinnamon leaf extract (CLE), powder in hydrosol (PH), and powder in water (PW). 
Additionally, both CLEN and CLE treatments indicated a dose-dependent 
improvement in AD rats, while PH and PW were effective in preventing AD 
occurrence. Furthermore, AD occurrence accompanied by PD development was 
demonstrated in this study. With the exception of the induction group, declines 
in Aβ40, BACE1, and 8-oxodG in the hippocampi and AchE and MDA in the cortices 
of rats were observed for all the treatments, with the high-dose CLEN (90 mg/kg 
bw) exhibiting the highest efficiency. The antioxidant enzyme activity, 
including that of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, in the cortices of rats increased. In 
addition, dopamine content, a vital index of PD, was increased in the striata of 
rats, accompanied by elevations in SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px and decreased MDA in rat 
livers. Conclusions: These outcomes suggest that the CLEN possesses significant 
potential for formulation into a functional food or botanical drug for the 
prevention and treatment of AD and/or PD in the future.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge in modern healthcare, 
prompting exploration into novel therapeutic strategies. This review clearly 
classifies different types of gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) (AuNPs), links them 
to the gut-brain axis, highlights recent advances, and points out future 
research needs, offering a more updated perspective than earlier reviews. 
Diverse approaches have emerged from single to hybrid and functionalized AuNPs, 
including innovative nanotherapeutic agents like Au nanorods-polyethylene 
glycol-angiopep-2 peptide/D1 peptide and noninvasive dynamic magnetic 
field-stimulated NPs. AuNPs have been reported for the neuroprotective 
properties. Clinical applications of AuNPs highlight their promise in diagnosis 
and therapeutic monitoring. However, challenges persist, notably in overcoming 
blood-brain barrier limitations and refining drug delivery systems. Furthermore, 
the incomplete understanding of AD's physiological and pathological mechanisms 
hinders therapeutic development. Future research directions should prioritize 
elucidating these mechanisms and optimizing AuNPs physicochemical properties for 
therapeutic efficacy. Despite limitations, nanomaterial-based therapies hold 
promise for revolutionizing AD treatment and addressing other central nervous 
system disorders. It also emphasizes the importance of further investigation 
into the potential of AuNPs, envisioning a future where they serve as a 
cornerstone in advancing neurological healthcare.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, represent unmet medical and social 
needs. Still, no definitive cure exists for these illnesses, hence a therapeutic 
approach with molecules able to prevent/downtone/modify the disease seems highly 
attractive. Remarkably, a higher risk of neurodegenerative disease is associated 
with low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is a multifaceted molecule able to target 
critical neuroinflammatory processes underlying neurodegeneration, acting 
through genomic or rapid signaling. This narrative review aims to focus on 
vitamin D's potential to be an optimal neuroprotective molecule, based on its 
ability to target and counteract aberrant biomolecular processes involved in 
neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. Noticeably, exercise can potentiate vitamin 
D's protective effect through some anti-inflammatory actions exerted on shared 
biomolecular targets. Thus, although vitamin D is not strictly a drug, it could 
be potentially allocated within the therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative 
diseases in combination with adapted exercise, best as an early intervention. 
Topics on the complexity concerning the doses for supplementation and data 
discrepancy from trials are addressed. The urgent demand is to test and clarify 
vitamin D efficacy and safety, combined or not with exercise, in clinical 
settings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cholinergic deficits and neuronal 
damage, making acetylcholinesterase (AChE) a crucial therapeutic target. 
Cyanidin derivatives, sourced from the diet as anthocyanins, exhibit 
neuroprotective properties, yet comparative investigations are scarce. This 
research explored the neuroprotective impacts of five cyanidin derivatives, 
namely cyanidin-3-O-(trans-p-coumaroyl)-diglycoside (C3GG), 
cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (C3R), cyanidin-3-O-arabinoside (C3A), 
cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside (C3S), and cyanidin-3-O-xyloside (C3X), utilizing an 
aluminum-chloride (AlCl3)-induced zebrafish model of AD. The administration of 
these compounds ameliorated zebrafish locomotor impairments, suppressed AChE 
activity, decreased brain oxidative stress levels, upregulated AD-related gene 
expression, and mitigated brain tissue pathological changes. Molecular docking 
and dynamics simulations indicated that cyanidin derivatives exhibit robust 
binding affinity and stable binding to AChE. Particularly, C3R demonstrated the 
most potent multi-faceted neuroprotective effects among the tested derivatives, 
suggesting its potential as a promising lead compound for AD therapy.

Background/objectives: Interactions of infusions of Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, 
Yerba Mate, and green tea, with free radicals, were examined. The aim of these 
studies was to determine quenching of free radicals by the extracts from the 
selected plant raw materials that are useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease. Methods: The interactions were tested by an X-band (9.3 GHz) EPR 
spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The model DPPH free radicals were 
used. The magnitude and changes with time of EPR and UV-Vis spectra of DPPH by 
the tested extracts were measured. Results: EPR and UV-Vis lines of DPPH free 
radicals decrease with increasing time of interactions of the extracts with 
DPPH, and after reaching the minimum value, it does not change with time. 
Ginseng infusion quenched free radicals the least. Ginkgo biloba extract 
quenches free radicals a little stronger than ginseng extract. Taking into 
account the tested extracts, Ginkgo biloba and ginseng extracts interact with 
free radicals less effectively compared to extracts of Yerba mate and green tea. 
Ginkgo biloba and ginseng extracts quench free radicals weaker than Yerba Mate 
and green tea extracts. Conclusions: Yerba Mate extract definitely had the 
strongest antioxidant properties. This extract quenches free radicals most 
effectively, what can be useful in the case of Alzheimer's disease. Given its 
strong antioxidant properties, green tea extract can also be particularly 
recommended in the case of Alzheimer's disease.

Background: Multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs), particularly those combining 
cholinesterase inhibition with additional mechanisms, are promising candidates 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. Based on our previous identification of a 
dual-active coumarin derivative, we designed a new series of 
7-alkoxyamino-3-(1,2,3-triazole)-coumarins. Methods: These compounds were 
synthesized by a new Sonogashira protocol and evaluated for AChE and BChE 
inhibition, enzymatic kinetics, molecular docking, neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y 
cells, neuroprotection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress, and additional 
interactions with H3R and MAOs. Results: All derivatives inhibited AChE with 
IC50 values of 4-104 nM, displaying high selectivity over BChE (up to 686-fold). 
Kinetic and docking studies indicated mixed-type inhibition involving both CAS 
and PAS. The most potent compounds (1h, 1j, 1k, 1q) were non-neurotoxic up to 50 
µM, while 1h and 1k also showed neuroprotective effects at 12.5 µM. Selected 
derivatives (1b, 1h, 1q) demonstrated multitarget potential, including H3R 
affinity (Ki as low as 32 nM for 1b) and MAO inhibition (IC50 of 1688 nM for 
1q). Conclusions: This series of coumarin-triazole derivatives combines potent 
and selective AChE inhibition with neuroprotective and multitarget activities, 
highlighting their promise as candidates for AD therapy.

Background: Current Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments primarily focus on 
symptom management and offer limited potential to arrest disease progression. To 
address this limitation, we developed baicalin-myricetin (BM) functionalized 
selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), termed BMSe@BSA, aimed at multi-targeted 
neuroprotection. Materials and Methods: BMSe@BSA nanoparticles were synthesized 
via a gel-sol technique using bovine serum albumin (BSA), ascorbic acid, 
selenous acid, and BM. Interactions among BSA, BM, and SeNPs were characterized 
by microscopy and spectrometry. Cytotoxicity was assessed on RAW 264.7 and PC12 
cells to determine biocompatibility. Neuroinflammation and cognitive function 
were evaluated in C57BL6/J mice challenged with Aβ1-42. Recognition memory was 
tested through open-field exploration, novel object recognition (NOR), and 
T-maze assays. Inflammatory markers (IL-1β and TNF-α) and microglial changes in 
the cerebral cortex were quantified, while amyloid fibril morphology was 
assessed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results: Spectroscopic analysis 
verified successful BM functionalization. Transmission electron microscopy 
revealed a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 90.57 nm, zeta 
potential of 27.2 mV, and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.270. BM entrapment 
efficiency reached approximately 90%. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed the 
nanoparticles' safety, with no toxicity observed at concentrations up to 400 
µg/mL after 4 h of incubation. BMSe@BSA effectively inhibited amyloid fibril 
formation, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, preserved 
neuronal integrity, and significantly enhanced cognitive performance in AD mouse 
models. Conclusion: BMSe@BSA appear as a potential nanotherapeutic approach for 
targeted brain delivery and multi-pathway intervention in Alzheimer's disease.

Vascular Dementia: From Pathophysiology to Therapeutic Frontiers.

University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.

Vascular dementia (VaD) represents the second-most common dementia type after 
Alzheimer's disease since it results from complications of cerebrovascular 
disease. Mixed pathologies combining vascular and neurodegenerative processes 
are the rule rather than exception in elderly dementia patients. The condition 
known as VaD includes various types of vascular damage that affect both large 
and small blood vessels in the brain which results in cerebral hypoperfusion, 
blood-brain barrier disruption, glymphatic dysfunction, and molecular cascades 
causing neuronal damage. The mechanisms of VaD include endothelial dysfunction, 
oxidative stress, chronic neuroinflammation, impaired glymphatic clearance, 
white matter demyelination, and synaptic failure. The disease susceptibility of 
individuals depends on genetic factors which include NOTCH3 mutations and 
vascular risk polymorphisms. The diagnostic field uses neuroimaging tools and 
fluid biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain, inflammatory markers, and 
Aβ/tau ratios for mixed pathology. The current practice of vascular risk 
management combines with new therapeutic approaches that use phosphodiesterase 
inhibitors for cerebral perfusion and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors for 
neuroinflammation, senolytics for cellular senescence, and remyelination agents 
for white matter repair. However, the majority of new treatment methods remain 
investigational with limited Phase III data. Future medical treatment 
development will depend on precision medicine approaches which use 
biomarker-guided treatment selection and combination strategies targeting 
multiple pathological mechanisms.

Contemporary diabetes management is progressively moving away from a 
glucocentric approach, with growing expectations that novel antidiabetic agents 
offer benefits beyond glycaemic control. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as a cornerstone in the treatment of type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to reducing blood glucose levels by 
promoting renal glucose excretion, these agents contribute significantly to 
cardio-renal-metabolic protection and are associated with improved 
cardiovascular outcomes and prolonged survival. Although SGLT2 inhibitors do not 
exhibit a class effect in all clinical aspects, growing evidence suggests their 
potential in a variety of additional therapeutic areas. We conducted an in-depth 
review of current scientific literature and clinical studies regarding this 
class of drugs. SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrate neuroprotective properties and may 
provide benefits in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease, potentially through the improvement of mitochondrial 
function and attenuation of inflammatory responses. Their anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidative effects are closely linked to reductions in cardiac and renal 
fibrosis. Other observed benefits include weight loss, improved insulin 
sensitivity, normalization of serum uric acid, and a reduction in hepatic 
steatosis-each with important metabolic implications. Furthermore, SGLT2 
inhibitors have been shown to positively influence iron metabolism and improve 
erythrocyte indices. Emerging data also indicate beneficial effects in women 
with polycystic ovary syndrome. Another promising area of investigation involves 
the modulation of Klotho protein expression and support of vascular homeostasis. 
In oncology, SGLT2 inhibitors are gaining attention, with encouraging 
preclinical results observed in malignancies such as pancreatic, thyroid, 
breast, and lung cancers. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the existing 
body of evidence, it is anticipated that the clinical indications for SGLT2 
inhibitors will expand beyond the cardio-renal-metabolic axis in the near 
future.

Background and Objective: Humanized models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) provide 
valuable tools for investigating the mechanisms of this neurodegenerative 
disorder, the leading cause of dementia. These models enable the study of AD 
progression and the potential disease-modifying properties of drugs or dietary 
nutrients delivered through nutrition. Here, we examine molecular markers of 
metabolic and synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus of 6-month-old 3×Tg-AD 
mice and assess whether a dietary insulin sensitizer can delay synaptic decline. 
Methods: First we characterized the molecular phenotype of 3×Tg-AD at 12 months 
using shotgun proteomics and phosphoproteomics to assess metabolic and synaptic 
changes in the hippocampus. Then, we characterized the effects of early daily 
oral D-chiro-inositol (DCI, Gyneos®) for three months, starting at 3 months of 
age, to test restoration of insulin signaling and glutamatergic synaptic 
markers. To this end we evaluated a) insulin signaling pathway components 
(insulin receptor, IRS1, PI3K, AKT, GSK3β) at mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation 
levels, and b) the expression of glutamate receptors (mGluR5, GluR1, GluR2, 
NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B). Sex effects were explored. Results: 12-month 3×Tg-AD 
mice exhibit metabolic and synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus, with 
phosphoproteomic changes suggesting altered glutamatergic synapses. At 6 months, 
disruptions in insulin signaling were evident, including altered expression and 
phosphorylation of insulin pathway components, and changes in glutamate receptor 
subunits. Early DCI treatment largely reversed these alterations. Several 
effects showed sex dependency. Conclusions: Early insulin-sensitizing 
intervention via DCI can restore insulin signaling and counteract hippocampal 
synaptic impairments in this AD model, supporting the potential for 
nutrient-based strategies to delay synaptic decline. Sex differences underscore 
the need to tailor therapeutic approaches in modifying AD progression.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: As global aging accelerates, prevalence of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) continues to rise, challenging healthcare systems and 
diminishing older adults' quality of life. There is great interest in better 
understanding the neuroprotective/anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids but the results from many published studies in 
humans come to different conclusions. This review aims to clarify the efficacy 
of n-3 fatty acids as a preventive or therapeutic strategy for cognitive health 
and to inform future clinical recommendations within aging populations.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines and a registered PROSPERO protocol, we 
reviewed systematic reviews (SRs) from 2014 to 2024 assessing exclusive n-3 
fatty acid supplementation and cognitive outcomes via MMSE. Data were extracted 
on intervention details and cognitive scores. Meta-analyses used fixed and 
random-effects models, with Hedges' estimating overall impact. Quality was 
assessed using AMSTAR-2, and statistical analyses were performed (SPSS 28).
RESULTS: A total of nine SRs incorporating 14 RCTs were included, representing 
26,881 participants aged 40 years or older. The pooled random-effects 
meta-analysis showed a statistically significant but modest improvement in MMSE 
scores (effect size: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.01-0.32). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 
42.8%), and no publication bias was detected. Further analyses revealed no 
significant associations between treatment duration or dosage and cognitive 
outcomes, suggesting a threshold effect rather than a dose-response 
relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support n3-PUFA supplementation as a complementary 
approach to lifestyle-based strategies for cognitive health, including diet, 
physical activity, sleep optimization, and cognitive training. While benefits 
appear modest, consistent effects across studies warrant further high-quality 
research and well-designed studies to strengthen clinical recommendations.
