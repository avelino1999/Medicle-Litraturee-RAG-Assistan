BACKGROUND: The use of cholinesterase inhibitors (CHEIs) is commonly associated 
with urinary incontinence in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study 
evaluated the risk of antimuscarinic initiation drugs with the use of CHEIs in 
AD patients.
METHODS: The study used a nested case-control study design involving 2013-2015 
Medicare data of AD patients 65 years and older without antimuscarinic use in 
2013. Cases were defined as those who initiated antimuscarinic treatment in 
2014-2015. Controls with no antimuscarinic use were selected through incidence 
density sampling and matched to cases on age using a variable-ratio method. The 
CHEI utilization pattern was classified as current (event-30 days), recent 
(event-31 to event-90 days), and past (event-91 to event-180 days). Conditional 
logistic regression was used to assess the association between CHEI use and the 
risk of antimuscarinic initiation.
RESULTS: This study included 1,909 cases and 9,064 controls. The adjusted model 
found that overall CHEI (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.90, 95 % Confidence 
Interval [CI]: 1.58-2.28) and current CHEI use (aOR = 1.62, 95 % CI: 1.18-2.21) 
were associated with an increase in the risk of antimuscarinic initiation 
compared to non-CHEI use. In addition, the current use of donepezil and 
rivastigmine significantly increased the risk of antimuscarinic initiation by 48 
% (95 % CI: 1.03-2.12) and 171 % (95 % CI: 1.46-5.03), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study found an increased risk of antimuscarinic initiation with 
the current use of CHEIs, particularly with donepezil and rivastigmine. These 
findings underscore the need for careful medication management to minimize 
prescribing cascades and associated consequences in AD.

The production of neurotoxic amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) is central to the 
initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and involves sequential 
cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. APP and 
the secretases are transmembrane proteins and their co-localisation in the same 
membrane-bound sub-compartment is necessary for APP cleavage. The intracellular 
trafficking of APP and the β-secretase, BACE1, is critical in regulating APP 
processing and Aβ production and has been studied in several cellular systems. 
Here, we summarise the intracellular distribution and transport of APP and its 
secretases, and the intracellular location for APP cleavage in non-polarised 
cells and neuronal models. In addition, we review recent advances on the 
potential impact of familial AD mutations on APP trafficking and processing. 
This is critical information in understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD 
progression and in supporting the development of novel strategies for clinical 
treatment.

The hallmark pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) consist of senile 
plaques, which are formed by extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and 
neurofibrillary tangles, which are formed by the hyperphosphorylation of 
intra-neuronal tau proteins. With the increase in clinical studies, the in vivo 
imbalance of iron homeostasis and the dysfunction of synaptic plasticity have 
been confirmed to be involved in AD pathogenesis. All of these mechanisms are 
constituted by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded or conformationally 
altered protein aggregates, which in turn drive AD progression. Proteostatic 
imbalance has emerged as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of AD. 
Ubiquitination modification is a major pathway for maintaining protein 
homeostasis, and protein degradation is primarily carried out by the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In this review, we provide an overview of the 
ubiquitination modification processes and related protein ubiquitination 
degradation pathways in AD, focusing on the microtubule-associated protein Tau, 
amyloid precursor protein (APP), divalent metal transporter protein 1 (DMT1), 
and α-amino-3-hyroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. We 
also discuss recent advances in ubiquitination-based targeted therapy for AD, 
with the aim of contributing new ideas to the development of novel therapeutic 
interventions for AD.

Postmortem MRI allows brain anatomy to be examined at high resolution and to 
link pathology measures with morphometric measurements. However, automated 
segmentation methods for brain mapping in postmortem MRI are not well developed, 
primarily due to limited availability of labeled datasets, and heterogeneity in 
scanner hardware and acquisition protocols. In this work, we present a 
high-resolution dataset of 135 postmortem human brain tissue specimens imaged at 
0.3 mm3 isotropic using a T2w sequence on a 7T whole-body MRI scanner. We 
developed a deep learning pipeline to segment the cortical mantle by 
benchmarking the performance of nine deep neural architectures, followed by 
post-hoc topological correction. We evaluate the reliability of this pipeline 
via overlap metrics with manual segmentation in 6 specimens, and intra-class 
correlation between cortical thickness measures extracted from the automatic 
segmentation and expert-generated reference measures in 36 specimens. We also 
segment four subcortical structures (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and 
thalamus), white matter hyperintensities, and the normal appearing white matter, 
providing a limited evaluation of accuracy. We show generalizing capabilities 
across whole-brain hemispheres in different specimens, and also on unseen images 
acquired at 0.28 mm3 and 0.16 mm3 isotropic T2*w fast low angle shot (FLASH) 
sequence at 7T. We report associations between localized cortical thickness and 
volumetric measurements across key regions, and semi-quantitative 
neuropathological ratings in a subset of 82 individuals with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) continuum diagnoses. Our code, Jupyter notebooks, and the containerized 
executables are publicly available at the project webpage

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease modulated 
by autoantibodies that inflame and destroy the myelin sheath encasing neuronal 
axons, impairing proper axonal conduction and function. Glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonists have been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory and 
neuroprotective effects, making these drugs particularly exciting prospects in 
the treatment of MS. While the exact mechanism remains unclear, GLP-1 receptor 
agonists may modulate inflammatory responses by targeting GLP-1 receptors 
present on immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes. In 
animal models, GLP-1 agonists have been shown to significantly delay the onset 
and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalopathy symptoms, as well as to 
increase nerve myelination and brain weight. In further experiments using animal 
models of nerve crush injury, specimens given GLP-1 agonists reported a 
significant increase in the rate and density of nerve regeneration compared to 
controls. Thus, GLP-1 agonists show promise as both prophylactic and symptomatic 
treatment for MS and may provide further utility in the treatment of other 
autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative conditions.

Neuroinflammation and mitochondrial function are crucial for neuronal function 
and survival. SS-31 is a novel mitochondria-targeted peptide antioxidant that 
reduces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, increases ATP 
generation, protects the integrity of mitochondrial cristae and the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain, and reduces inflammatory responses. Exploring 
novel SS-31 derivatives is important for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases. In this study, nineteen SS-31 derived peptides (5a-5s) were 
synthesized. Through cellular activity screening, we discovered that 5f and 5g 
exhibited significantly greater anti-inflammatory activity compared to SS-31, 
reducing LPS-induced TNF-α levels by 43% and 45%, respectively, at a 
concentration of 10 μM. Furthermore, treatment with 50 nM of 5f and 5g increased 
ATP synthesis by 42% and 41% in rotenone-induced HT22 cells and attenuated 
mitochondrial ROS production by preserving mitochondrial integrity. These 
findings demonstrate their direct protective effects on neuronal mitochondria. 
This work highlights the potential of 5f and 5g in the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation and mitochondrial 
damage, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for mitochondrial-related 
conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: As the population ages, the occurrence of cognitive decline and 
dementia is continuously increasing. Frailty is a prevalent problem among older 
adults. Epidemiologic studies have shown a comorbidity between frailty and 
cognitive impairment. However, their relationship remains unclear. The frailty 
index is an important indicator for measuring frailty. This study aims to 
investigate the relationship between frailty index and cognitive dysfunction in 
older adults aged 60 years and older in the United States from the 2011-2014 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older from 2011 to 
2014 were extracted from the NHANES database. The frailty index was calculated 
using the formula: frailty index = total number of deficits present/total number 
of deficits measured. The Animal Fluency (AF), the Digit Symbol Substitution 
Test (DSST), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease 
Delayed Recall (CERAD-DR), and Word Learning (CERAD-WL) were used to evaluate 
cognitive dysfunction. Firstly, weighted logistic regression analysis was used 
to explore the relationship between frailty index and cognitive dysfunction. 
Secondly, the influence of covariates on the frailty index was evaluated by 
subgroup analysis and interaction. Finally, the non-linear relationship is 
discussed by using the restricted cubic spline regression model.
RESULTS: Our study included a total of 2,574 patients, weighted logistic 
regression analysis, after adjusting for all covariates, showed that the frailty 
index was associated with every test score. The interaction showed that 
covariates had no significant effect on this association in AF. The association 
between the frailty index and AF in the restricted cubic spline regression model 
is non-linear. As the frailty index increased, the risk of AF reduction 
increased, suggesting a higher risk of cognitive dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: In general, a high frailty index appears to be associated with an 
increased risk of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. Consequently, protecting 
against cognitive decline necessitates making geriatric frailty prevention and 
treatment top priorities.

[18F]Flortaucipir is an FDA-approved tau-PET tracer that is increasingly 
utilized in clinical settings for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Still, a 
large-scale comparison of the in vivo PET uptake to quantitative post-mortem tau 
pathology and to other co-pathologies is lacking. Here, we examined the 
correlation between in vivo [18F]flortaucipir PET uptake and quantitative 
post-mortem tau pathology in corresponding brain regions from the AVID A16 
end-of-life study (n = 63). All participants underwent [18F]flortaucipir PET 
scans prior to death, followed by a detailed post-mortem neuropathological 
examination using AT8 (tau) immunohistochemistry. Correlations between 
[18F]flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) and AT8 
immunohistochemistry were assessed across 18 regions-of-interest (ROIs). To 
assess [18F]flortaucipir specificity and level of detection for tau pathology, 
correlations between [18F]flortaucipir SUVR and neuritic plaque score and TDP-43 
stage were also computed and retention was further assessed in individuals with 
possible primary age-related tauopathy (PART), defined as Thal phase ≤ 2 and 
Braak stage I-IV. We found modest-to-strong correlations between in vivo 
[18F]flortaucipir SUVR and post-mortem tau pathology density in corresponding 
brain regions in all neocortical regions analyzed (rho-range = 0.61-0.79, 
p < 0.0001 for all). The detection threshold of [18F]flortaucipir PET was 
determined to be 0.85% of surface area affected by tau pathology in a temporal 
meta-ROI, and 0.15% in a larger cortical meta-ROI. No significant associations 
were found between [18F]flortaucipir SUVRs and post-mortem tau pathology in 
individuals with possible PART. Further, there was no correlation observed 
between [18F]flortaucipir and level of amyloid-β neuritic plaque load 
(rho-range =  - 0.16-0.12; p = 0.48-0.61) or TDP-43 stage (rho-range =  - 0.10 
to  - 0.30; p = 0.18-0.65). In conclusion, our in vivo vs post-mortem study 
shows that the in vivo [18F]flortaucipir PET signal primarily reflects tau 
pathology, also at relatively low densities of tau proteinopathy, and does not 
bind substantially to tau neurites in neuritic plaques or in individuals with 
PART.

PURPOSE: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by worsening of speech and/or language. Script training 
intervention promotes automatized speech production via repeated practice of 
scripted content. This study evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and 
effects of a modified version of Video-Implemented Script Training for Aphasia 
(VISTA) in the three PPA variants and compared outcomes by intervention modality 
(teletherapy vs. in person).
METHOD: Thirteen bilingual (Spanish-Catalan) participants were included 
(semantic variant, n = 5; logopenic variant, n = 5; nonfluent/agrammatic 
variant, n = 3; teletherapy, n = 7). Using a nonrandomized design, intervention 
was administered in participants' dominant language. Participants were trained 
on an individualized script twice per week, over 8 weeks. Performance on 
measures related to script accuracy, content, and subjective ratings of 
production quality was evaluated at baseline, immediately post, and at 3 and 6 
months post-intervention.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed on the basis of intervention 
modality. Participants demonstrated significant improvements from pre- to 
post-intervention in script production, synonym production, keywords, and global 
quality on the trained script. Maintenance was observed when comparing 
performance at post-intervention relative to 3- and 6-month follow-up for script 
and synonym production. Significant improvement in production quality of the 
untrained topic was observed following intervention. Different patterns of 
benefit were observed by PPA variant.
CONCLUSIONS: Modified VISTA was acceptable and effective across the three PPA 
variants, as evidenced by improvements on a broader array of outcome measures 
than those previously reported. Findings also provide further support for 
provision for teletherapy in individuals with PPA.

Population aging is a global reality driven by increased life expectancy. This 
demographic phenomenon is intrinsically linked to the epidemic of cognitive 
disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, posing challenges for 
elderly and their families. In this context, the search for new therapeutic 
strategies to prevent or minimize cognitive impairments becomes urgent, as these 
deficits are primarily associated with oxidative damage and increased 
neuroinflammation. Ferulic acid (FA), a natural and potent antioxidant compound, 
is proposed to be nanoencapsulated to target the central nervous system 
effectively with lower doses and an extended duration of action. Here, we 
evaluated the effects of the nanoencapsulated FA on d-galactose (d-Gal)- induced 
memory impairments. Male Wistar adult rats were treated with ferulic acid-loaded 
nanocapsules (FA-Nc) or non-encapsulated ferulic acid (D-FA) for 8 weeks 
concurrently with d-Gal (150 mg/kg s.c.) injection. As expected, our findings 
showed that d-Gal injection impaired memory processes and increased anxiety 
behavior, whereas FA-Nc treatment ameliorated these behavioral impairments 
associated with the aging process induced by d-Gal. At the molecular level, 
nanoencapsulated ferulic acid (FA-Nc) ameliorated the decrease in ACh and 
glutamate induced by d-galactose (d-Gal), and also increased GABA levels in the 
dorsal hippocampus, indicating its therapeutic superiority. Additional studies 
are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying our current promising 
outcomes. Nanoscience applied to pharmacology can reduce drug dosage, thereby 
minimizing adverse effects while enhancing therapeutic response, particularly in 
neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. Therefore, the strategy of 
brain-targeted drug delivery through nanoencapsulation can be effective in 
mitigating aging-related factors that may lead to cognitive deficits.

BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are 
increasingly used to manage type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Despite their 
recognized benefits in glycemic control and weight management, their impact on 
broader systemic has been less explored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of GLP-1RAs on a variety of 
systemic diseases in people with T2D or obesity.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Global 
Collaborative Network, accessed through the TriNetX analytics platform. The 
study comprised two primary groups: individuals with T2D and those with obesity. 
Each group was further divided into subgroups based on whether they received 
GLP-1RA treatment or not. Data were analyzed over more than a 5-year follow-up 
period, comparing incidences of systemic diseases; systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE), systemic sclerosis (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ulcerative colitis 
(UC), crohn's disease (CD), alzheimer's disease (AD), parkinson's disease (PD), 
dementia, bronchial asthma (BA), osteoporosis, and several cancers.
RESULTS: In the T2D cohorts, GLP-1RA treatment was associated with significantly 
lower incidences of several systemic and metabolic conditions as compared to 
those without GLP-1RA, specifically, dementia (Risk Difference (RD): -0.010, 
p < 0.001), AD (RD: -0.003, p < 0.001), PD (RD: -0.002, p < 0.001), and 
pancreatic cancer (RD: -0.003, p < 0.001). SLE and SS also saw statistically 
significant reductions, though the differences were minor in magnitude (RD: 
-0.001 and - 0.000 respectively, p < 0.001 for both). Conversely, BA a showed a 
slight increase in risk (RD: 0.002, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RAs demonstrate potential benefits in reducing the risk of 
several systemic conditions in people with T2D or obesity. Further prospective 
studies are needed to confirm these effects fully and understand the mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) might 
become available in Germany soon. The combination of a large pool of prevalent 
cases and a complex diagnostic process to determine eligibility for these 
treatments is likely to challenge health systems' capacity.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze Germany's healthcare system capacity to identify 
treatment-eligible patients in a timely and equitable manner.
METHODS: We modeled patients' diagnostic journey and projects wait times due to 
capacity constraints for AD specialist visits and PET scans from 2024 to 2043. 
Model parameters were derived from published data and expert input.
RESULTS: Wait times would be ∼50 months over the model horizon, if patients were 
referred to specialists based on a brief cognitive assessment in primary care. 
Wait times for patients with social health insurance are projected to be 1.9 
times those of patients with private insurance, with peak wait times of around 
76 and 40 months, respectively. Adding a blood test for the AD pathology as 
additional triage step would reduce wait times to below 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of having a well-resourced health system, Germany is 
projected to be unable to cope with the demand for biomarker-based AD diagnosis, 
if a disease-modifying AD treatment were introduced. As these treatments might 
become available by the end of 2024, decisive action, in particular 
dissemination of high-performing AD blood tests for triage in primary care, will 
be needed to prevent delays in access and potentially avoidable and inequitable 
disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Drug-induced adverse symptoms affect patients' quality of life (QoL) 
during treatment. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of drug-induced 
adverse effects could help prevent them. As current drugs have limited effects 
in halting the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients are required to 
take these drugs over a long period. The main obstacles to long-term compliance 
are drug-elicited side effects that deteriorate patient QoL.
OBJECTIVE: Donepezil, the most popular acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) 
drug for AD, induces various side effects, especially at high doses. This study 
aimed to identify a drug that can attenuate the side effects of donepezil and 
investigate the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Five-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats received daily oral donepezil and 
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for four weeks. General symptoms following administration 
were monitored daily to address drug-related adverse effects. Cytosolic calcium 
influx and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after drug treatment were 
measured in vitro using C2C12 myotubes.
RESULTS: High-dose donepezil induced numerous adverse symptoms in male and 
female rats, which were markedly attenuated by co-treatment with NAC. NAC 
significantly reduced both acute and chronic muscle-related symptoms caused by 
donepezil. Additionally, in vitro studies showed that high-dose donepezil 
increased ROS and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels in muscle cells, 
contributing to these adverse effects. NAC co-treatment dramatically reduced ROS 
and [Ca2+]i levels in muscle cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with NAC effectively diminishes the adverse 
effects elicited by donepezil by regulating ROS and [Ca2+]i levels in the 
skeletal muscle, which could contribute to improving donepezil treatment in 
patients.

BACKGROUND: The significant increase in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia 
prevalence is a global health crisis, acutely impacting low- and lower-middle 
and upper-middle-income countries (LLMICs/UMICs).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify key barriers and gaps in 
dementia care and research in LLMICs and UMICs.
METHODS: We conducted an international, cross-sectional survey among clinicians 
and healthcare professionals (n = 249 in 34 countries) across LLMICs and UMICs, 
exploring patient demographics, use of clinical diagnosis, dementia evaluation, 
screening/evaluation tools, and care and treatment.
RESULTS: Significant disparities were found in diagnostic practices, access to 
assessments, and access to care. On average, clinicians in LLMICs saw more 
patients, had less time for evaluations, lower use of formal screening and 
tools, and less access to biomarkers. They were also under-resourced compared to 
UMICs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide insights for policymakers, healthcare 
organizations, and researchers to address the complex challenges associated with 
dementia care in diverse settings. Addressing these challenges requires a 
multipronged approach involving local, national, and international stakeholders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive 
conditions. Family caregivers of patients, especially those caring for patients 
with ADRD exhibiting behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), 
undergo significant physical and mental changes during long-term care. While 
most researchers have focused on the specific needs of family caregivers, the 
comprehensive understanding of these needs is limited. In this study, Alderfer's 
existence, relatedness, and growth theory was used to develop an interview 
framework to systematically and comprehensively understand the needs of family 
caregivers of individuals with ADRD.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand family caregivers' 
needs in coping with BPSD in individuals with ADRD, aiming to alleviate 
caregivers' stress and promote their overall well-being.
METHODS: This study used a hermeneutic-phenomenological interview research 
design. Data were collected via remote conferences involving interviews with 17 
participants selected via maximum variation sampling. The Colaizzi seven-step 
method was utilized, and the interview contents were analyzed using NVivo 12.0 
software.
RESULTS: The needs of family caregivers in coping with the BPSD of individuals 
with ADRD could be summarized into three themes, namely existence needs, 
relatedness needs, and growth needs, and 10 sub-themes.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide new insights into the needs of family 
caregivers in coping with patients exhibiting BPSD. Family caregivers experience 
significant negative emotions, poor caregiving experiences, heavy caregiving 
burdens, and a desire for professional assistance and policy support.

BACKGROUND: About two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are women, 
most of whom are post-menopausal. Menopause accelerates dementia risk by 
increasing the risk for metabolic, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. 
Mid-life metabolic disease (obesity, diabetes/prediabetes) is a well-known risk 
factor for dementia. A high fat diet can lead to poor metabolic health in both 
humans and rodents.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine the effects of a high fat diet on metabolic 
outcomes in the AppNL-F knock-in mouse model of AD and assess the effects of 
menopause.
METHODS: First, 3-month-old AppNL-F and WT female mice were placed on either a 
control or a high fat diet until 10 months of age then assessed for metabolic 
outcomes. Next, we did a more extensive assessment in AppNL-F mice that were 
administered VCD (4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide) or vehicle (oil) and placed on a 
control or high fat diet for 7 months. VCD was used to model menopause by 
causing accelerated ovarian failure.
RESULTS: Compared to WT controls, AD female mice had worse glucose intolerance. 
Menopause led to metabolic impairment (weight gain and glucose intolerance) and 
further exacerbated obesity in response to a high fat diet. There were 
interactions between diet and menopause on some metabolic health serum 
biomarkers and the expression of hypothalamic markers related to energy balance.
CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the need to model endocrine aging in animal 
models of dementia and will contribute to further understanding the interaction 
between menopause and metabolic health in the context of AD.

Background: Growing evidence highlights the relevance of the 
microbiota-gut-brain axis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients display gut 
dysbiosis, altered intestinal barrier and enteric inflammation that, besides 
bowel symptoms, can contribute to brain pathology. In this context, the 
modulation of gut microbiota is emerging as a therapeutical option to halt or 
slow down central pathology. Herein, we examined the effects of 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HEAL9 in a spontaneous mouse model of AD. Methods: 
Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice and control SAMR1 mice were 
treated orally with HEAL9 1 × 109 CFU per mouse per day or placebo for two 
months to evaluate the effects of the probiotic during the earliest stages of 
AD, before the development of brain pathology. Cognitive impairment, in vivo and 
in vitro colonic motility, astrocyte and microglia reactive response, brain and 
colonic amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1-42) levels, and inflammasome components activation 
(NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and interleukin-1β) were assessed. In addition, gut 
barrier alterations [circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) 
levels] and acidic mucus were evaluated. Results: HEAL9 administration 
significantly attenuated cognitive impairment and counteracted colonic 
dysmotility in SAMP8 mice. Moreover, HEAL9 decreased astrogliosis and 
microgliosis, Aβ1-42 accumulation and inflammasome activation in colon and brain 
and normalized plasma LBP levels and colonic acidic mucus content. Conclusion: 
HEAL9 intake alleviated cognitive decline and normalized colonic motility in the 
prodromal phases of AD via the modulation of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain 
signalling. Thus, dietary supplementation with HEAL9 could be considered as a 
suitable therapeutical option for the treatment of AD and related intestinal 
symptoms in the early stages of the disease.

Seven treatments are approved for Alzheimer's disease, but five of them only 
relieve symptoms and do not alter the course of the disease. Aducanumab (Adu) 
and lecanemab are novel disease-modifying antiamyloid-β (Aβ) human monoclonal 
antibodies that specifically target the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and were recently approved for its treatment. However, their administration 
is associated with serious side effects, and their use is limited to early 
stages of the disease. Therefore, drug discovery remains of great importance in 
AD research. To gain new insights into the development of novel drugs for 
Alzheimer's disease, a combination of techniques was employed, including 
mutation screening, molecular dynamics, and quantum biochemistry. These were 
used to outline the interfacial interactions of the Aducanumab::Aβ2-7 complex. 
Our analysis identified critical stabilizing contacts, revealing up to 40% 
variation in the affinity of the Adu chains for Aβ2-7 depending on the 
conformation outlined. Remarkably, two complementarity determining regions 
(CDRs) of the Adu heavy chain (HCDR3 and HCDR2) and one CDR of the Adu light 
chain (LCDR3) accounted for approximately 77% of the affinity of Adu for Aβ2-7, 
confirming their critical role in epitope recognition. A single mutation, 
originally reported to have the potential to increase the affinity of Adu for 
Aβ2-7, was shown to decrease its structural stability without increasing the 
overall binding affinity. Mimetic peptides that have the potential to inhibit Aβ 
aggregation were designed by using computational outcomes. Our results support 
the use of these peptides as promising drugs with great potential as inhibitors 
of Aβ aggregation.

Quinoline represents a promising scaffold for developing potential drugs because 
of the wide range of biological and pharmacological activities that it exhibits. 
In the present study, quinoline derivatives obtained from CADMA-Chem docking 
protocol were investigated in the mean of molecular dynamics simulations as 
potential inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase enzyme. The examined species can be 
partitioned between neutral, dq815 (2,3 dihydroxyl-quinoline-4-carbaldehyde), 
dq829 (2,3 dihydroxyl-quinoline-8-carboxylic acid methane ester), dq1356 (3,4 
dihydroxyl-quinoline-6-carbaldehyde), dq1368 (3,4

dq815_dep, dq829_dep, dq1356_dep and dq2357_dep. Twelve molecular dynamics 
simulations were performed including those of natural acetylcholine, of the 
well-known donepezil inhibitor and of the founder quinoline chosen as reference. 
Key intermolecular interactions were detected and discussed to describe the 
different dynamic behavior of all the considered species. Binding energies 
calculation from MMPBSA well accounts for the dynamic behavior observed in the 
simulation time proposing dq1368 as promising candidate for the inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase. Retrosynthetic route for the production of the 
investigated compounds is also proposed.

Oxidative stress plays an important role in the occurrence of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Previous studies indicate a strong connection between oxidative 
stress, inappropriate activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Although antioxidant therapy is a 
valid strategy to alleviate these problems, the most important limitation of 
this approach is the ineffectiveness of drug administration due to the limited 
permeability of the BBB. Therefore, BBB-penetrating p38 MAPK modulators with 
proper antioxidant capacity could be useful in preventing/reducing the 
complications of neurodegenerative disorders. The current manuscript aims to 
review the therapeutic capabilities of some recently reviewed naturally 
occurring p38 MAPK inhibitors in the management of neurodegenerative problems 
such as Alzheimer's disease. In data collection, we tried to use more recent 
studies published in high-quality journals indexed in databases Scopus, Web of 
Science, PubMed, and so on, but no specific time frame was considered due to the 
nature of the study. Our evaluations indicate that natural compounds 
tanshinones, protoberberines, pinocembrin, osthole, rhynchophylline, oxymatrine, 
schisandrin, piperine, paeonol, ferulic acid, 6-gingerol, obovatol, and trolox 
have significant potential for use as supplements/adjuvants in the reduction of 
neurodegenerative-related problems. Our findings emphasize the usefulness of 
BBB-penetrating phytochemicals with p38 MAPK modulatory activity as potential 
therapeutic options against neurodegenerative disorders. Of course, the proper 
use of these compounds depends on considering their toxicity/safety profile and 
pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as the clinical conditions of users.

Polypharmacological drugs are of great value for treating complex human diseases 
by the combinative modulation of several biological targets. However, 
multitarget drug design with more than two targets is challenging and generally 
discovered by serendipity. Herein, a restricted fragment docking (RFD) 
computational method combined with a phenotypic discovery approach was developed 
for rational polypharmacological drug design. Via genetic and drug combination 
studies in a microglial phenotype, we first identified novel synergistic effects 
by triple target modulation toward RIPK1, MAP4K4, and ALK. Drawing on the RFD 
method to explore virtual chemical spaces in three target pockets, we identified 
a lead compound, LP-10d, that precisely modulated RIPK1/MAP4K4/ALK for 
synergistic microglial protection with low nanomolar potency. LP-10d showed 
polypharmacology against multiple neuropathologies in the 3xTg Alzheimer's 
disease mouse model. Our study revealed a potential application of the RFD 
method, which is valuable to further polypharmacological drug discovery involved 
in clinical studies for treating complex human diseases.

BACKGROUND: Effective interventions for overall healthy subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment are currently limited. Choline alphoscerate (alpha glyceryl 
phosphorylcholine, αGPC) is a choline-containing phospholipid used to treat 
cognitive function impairments in specific neurological conditions. This study 
aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of αGPC in individuals diagnosed 
with mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 100 study 
subjects with mild cognitive impairment underwent a double-blind SHCog™ soft 
capsule (600 mg αGPC) or placebo treatment for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy 
outcome included changes from baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Safety assessments included regular 
monitoring of adverse events, and clinical laboratory tests were conducted at 
baseline and the end of the trial.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks of αGPC treatment, the ADAS-cog score decreased by 2.34 
points, which was significantly greater than the change observed in the placebo 
group. No serious AEs were reported, and no study subjects discontinued the 
intervention because of AEs. There was no significant difference in incidence 
rate of AEs between the αGPC group and the placebo group.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that αGPC is a safe and effective intervention 
for improving cognitive function in study subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with an intricate 
pathophysiological mechanism. Oxidative stress has been shown in several 
investigations as a significant factor in AD progression. For instance, studies 
have confirmed that oxidative stress inhibition may considerably improve AD 
symptoms, with potent antioxidants being touted as a possible interventional 
strategy in the search for AD treatment. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) acts 
as a natural catechin that has antioxidant effect. It activates the kelch-like 
epichlorohydrin-associated proteins (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway to inhibit oxidative stress. The Keap1/Nrf2 
signal pathway is not only an upstream signaling target for a variety of 
antioxidant enzymes, but also minimizes high levels of reactive oxygen species. 
This report analyzes the antioxidant effect of EGCG in AD, elaborates its 
specific mechanism of action, and provides a theoretical basis for its clinical 
application in AD.

In this paper, we describe our process of changing language of the National 
Institute on Aging Imbedded Pragmatic Alzheimer's disease and AD-related 
dementias Clinical Trials Collaboratory (NIA IMPACT Collaboratory) "Stakeholder 
Engagement Team" to "Engaging Partners Team" in response to feedback from 
community partners regarding the problematic connotations of the term 
"stakeholder." We present a brief history of the term "stakeholder" and its use 
in clinical and community-engaged research. Then, we summarize critiques of this 
term, including its colonial history and potential to reinforce complacency with 
generational traumas, particularly among Indigenous peoples and communities. We 
conclude with a detailed overview of our team and organization's multi-step 
process to discontinue use of the term "stakeholder," in alignment with a 
theoretical model of organizational behavior change. This paper highlights the 
importance of critically evaluating language and responding to community 
partners. We hope our process can guide other researchers and organizations.

OBJECTIVE: Oropharyngeal dysphagia (dysphagia) is highly prevalent (up to 86%) 
in hospitalized patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). 
This study aims to describe the management and clinical course of dysphagia in 
hospitalized patients with ADRD.
DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted across 10 hospitals within a 
large health system in New York. Participants were older adults with ADRD 
admitted to the medicine service and diagnosed with dysphagia to liquids on 
speech-language pathologist (SLP) assessment and were recruited between January 
and June 2023.
METHODS: Baseline characteristics [eg, dementia Functional Assessment Staging 
Tool (FAST)], dysphagia management (eg, prescribed diet), and clinical course 
(eg, dysphagia improvement, respiratory complications) were collected.
RESULTS: Of patients with ADRD and dysphagia (n = 62), the average age was 86.5 
and 66.1% were FAST Stage 7. On admission, 48.4% had pneumonia, 79.0% had 
delirium, and 69.4% were made nil per os (NPO) for aspiration risk. Of those who 
received SLP reassessment after diet initiation (n = 25), 76% demonstrated 
dysphagia improvement; 75% of patients with FAST stage 7 demonstrated 
improvement. Respiratory complications occurred in 21.0% of patients on the 
following diets: NPO, nasogastric tube feeding, dysphagia diets, and comfort 
feeds. In univariate analyses, hospital-acquired dehydration, no dysphagia 
improvement, and delirium were associated with respiratory complications.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The potential for dysphagia improvement in 
hospitalized patients with ADRD (even those with advanced dementia) highlights 
the critical need for standardizing reassessment. Further studies are needed to 
evaluate factors associated with respiratory complications in this population.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-associated form of dementia 
characterized by the pathological deposition of toxic misfolded proteins in the 
central nervous system (CNS), which is closely related to the clearance 
impairment of meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs). Thus, enhancement dural 
meningeal lymphatic drainage to remove amyloid-β (Aβ) is usually considered as a 
potential therapeutic target for AD.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of Jiawei Xionggui 
Decoction (JWXG) to attenuate cognitive dificits in APP/PS1 mice with impaired 
meningeal lymphatic drainage.
METHODS: Ligation of deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLNs) was performed to 
establish the mice model of the impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage in APP/PS1 
mice. Cognitve behaviors and pathological morphology of mice were assessed. 
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) of mice was determined using Laser speckle contrast 
imaging analysis. Serum non-targeted metabolomics analysis was applied to 
decipher the mechanisms of JWXG in rescuing the impairment of mLVs, and C8-D1A 
cells were employed to validate in vitro.
RESULTS: Disruption of mLVs in APP/PS1 mice deteriorated cognitive dysfunction, 
accelerated Aβ burden and glia activation, accompanied by more severe 
neuropathological damage, CBF reduction and neuroinflammation exacerbation. 
Serum non-targeted metabolomics analysis indicates the increase of arachidonic 
acid (AA) metabolic pathway was the key contributor to the neuropathological 
exacerbation of dcLNs ligation APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, clinically 
equivalent dose of JWXG was sufficient to restore mLVs drainage and rescue 
cognitive performance by inhibiting neuroinflammation depended by AA metabolic 
pathway in dcLNs ligation APP/PS1 mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings establish a novel mechanism that rescue mLVs by 
inhibiting AA metabolic pathway to clear brain Aβ, and support JWXG as a 
feasible treatment strategy for AD by suppressing AA metabolic pathway to 
improve mLVs drainage efficiency.

BACKGROUND: The identification of patients with an elevated risk of developing 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and eligible for the disease-modifying 
treatments (DMTs) in the earliest stages is one of the greatest challenges in 
the clinical practice. Plasma biomarkers has the potential to predict these 
issues, but further research is still needed to translate them to clinical 
practice. Here we evaluated the clinical applicability of plasma pTau181 as a 
predictive marker of AD pathology in a large real-world cohort of a memory 
clinic.
METHODS: Three independent cohorts (modelling [n = 991, 59.7% female], testing 
[n = 642, 56.2% female] and validation [n = 441, 55.1% female]) of real-world 
patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), AD dementia, and other dementias were included. Paired cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were used to measure AT(N) CSF biomarkers and 
plasma pTau181.
FINDINGS: CSF and plasma pTau181 showed correlation in all phenotypes except in 
SCD and other dementias. Age significantly influenced the biomarker's 
performance. The general Aβ(+) vs Aβ(-) ROC curve showed an AUC = 0.77 
[0.74-0.80], whereas the specific ROC curve of MCI due to AD vs non-AD MCI 
showed an AUC = 0.89 [0.85-0.93]. A cut-off value of 1.30 pg/ml of plasma 
pTau181 exhibited a sensitivity of 93.57% [88.72-96.52], specificity of 72.38% 
[62.51-79.01], VPP of 77.85% [70.61-83.54], and 8.30% false negatives in the 
subjects with MCI of the testing cohort. The HR of cox regression showed that 
patients with MCI up to this cut-off value exhibited a HR = 1.84 [1.05-3.22] 
higher risk to convert to AD dementia than patients with MCI below the cut-off 
value.
INTERPRETATION: Plasma pTau181 has the potential to be used in the memory 
clinics as a screening biomarker of AD pathology in subjects with MCI, 
presenting a valuable prognostic utility in predicting the MCI conversion to AD 
dementia. In the context of a real-world population, a confirmatory test 
employing gold-standard procedures is still advisable.

Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are distinct neurodegenerative 
disorders characterized by progressive cognitive deficits and structural 
alterations in the brain. Schizophrenia typically emerges in adolescence or 
early adulthood with symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive 
impairments, whereas AD primarily affects elderly individuals, causing 
progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Delusional 
disorder, which often emerges later in life, shares some features with 
schizophrenia and is considered a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Patients with 
schizophrenia or delusional disorder, particularly women and those aged 65 years 
or older, have an increased risk of developing AD later in life. In contrast, 
approximately 30 % of AD patients exhibit psychotic symptoms, which accelerate 
cognitive decline and worsen health outcomes. This integrative review explored 
the genetic overlap between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and AD to identify 
potential shared genetic factors. The genetic correlations between schizophrenia 
and AD were weak but positive (rg=0.03-0.10). Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for 
schizophrenia and AD indicate some genetic predisposition, although findings are 
inconsistent among studies; e.g., PRS-schizophrenia or PRS-AD were associated 
with the risk of developing psychosis in patients with AD. A higher PRS for 
various developmental and psychiatric disorders was correlated with an earlier 
age at onset of schizophrenia. Research gaps include the need for studies on the 
impacts of PRS-AD on the risk of schizophrenia, genetic correlations between 
later-onset delusional disorder and AD, and genetic relationships between AD and 
late-onset schizophrenia (LOS) with a greater risk of progressing to AD. Further 
investigation into these genetic overlaps is crucial to enhance prevention, 
treatment, and prognosis for affected patients.

BACKGROUND: Pilot data suggest that off-label, unmonitored antiepileptic drug 
prescribing for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia is increasing, 
replacing other psychotropic medications targeted by purposeful reduction 
efforts. This trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although adverse 
outcomes related to this trend remain unknown, preliminary results hint that 
harms may be increasing and concentrated in vulnerable populations.
OBJECTIVE: Using a mixed methods approach including both a retrospective 
secondary data analysis and a national clinician survey, this study aims to 
describe appropriate and potentially inappropriate antiepileptic and other 
psychoactive drug prescribing in US nursing homes (NHs), characteristics and 
patient-oriented outcomes associated with this prescribing, and how these 
phenomena may be changing under the combined stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the pressure of reduction initiatives.
METHODS: To accomplish the objective, resident-level, mixed-effects regression 
models and interrupted time-series analyses will draw on cohort elements linked 
at an individual level from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 
(CMS) Minimum Data Set, Medicare Part D, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, 
and Outpatient and Public Use Files. Quarterly cohorts of NH residents 
(2009-2021) will incorporate individual-level data, including demographics; 
health status; disease variables; psychotropic medication claims; comprehensive 
NH health outcomes; hospital and emergency department adverse events; and NH 
details, including staffing resources and COVID-19 statistics. To help explain 
and validate findings, we will conduct a national qualitative survey of NH 
prescribers regarding their knowledge and beliefs surrounding changing 
approaches to dementia care and associated outcomes.
RESULTS: Funding was obtained in September 2022. Institutional review board 
exemption approval was obtained in January 2023. The CMS Data Use Agreement was 
submitted in May 2023 and signed in March 2024. Data access was obtained in June 
2024. Cohort creation is anticipated by January 2025, with crosswalks finalized 
by July 2025. The first survey was fielded in October 2023 and published in July 
2024. The second survey was fielded in March 2024. The results are in review as 
of July 2024. Iterative survey cycles will continue biannually until December 
2026. Multidisciplinary dissemination of survey analysis results began in July 
2023, and dissemination of secondary data findings is anticipated to begin 
January 2025. These processes are ongoing, with investigation to wrap up by June 
2027.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will detail appropriate and inappropriate antiepileptic 
drug use and related outcomes in NHs and describe disparities in long-stay 
subpopulations treated or not treated with psychotropics. It will delineate the 
impact of the pandemic in combination with national policies on dementia 
management and outcomes. We believe this mixed methods approach, including 
processes that link multiple CMS data sets at an individual level and 
survey-relevant stakeholders, can be replicated and applied to evaluate a 
variety of patient-oriented questions in diverse clinical populations.

Humans with monogenic inborn errors responsible for extreme disease phenotypes 
can reveal essential physiological pathways. We investigated germline mutations 
in GNAI2, which encodes Gαi2, a key component in heterotrimeric G protein signal 
transduction usually thought to regulate adenylyl cyclase-mediated cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Patients with activating Gαi2 
mutations had clinical presentations that included impaired immunity. Mutant 
Gαi2 impaired cell migration and augmented responses to T cell receptor (TCR) 
stimulation. We found that mutant Gαi2 influenced TCR signaling by sequestering 
the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating protein RASA2, thereby 
promoting RAS activation and increasing downstream extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT S6 signaling to drive cellular growth 
and proliferation.

OBJECTIVES: Among participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) we estimated the 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in apathy symptom severity on 
three scales.
DESIGN: Retrospective anchor- and distribution-based analyses of change in 
apathy symptom scores.
SETTING: Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET) and ADMET 2 randomized 
controlled trials conducted at three and ten clinics specialized in dementia 
care in United States and Canada, respectively.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and sixty participants (60 ADMET, 200 ADMET 2) with 
clinically significant apathy in Alzheimer's disease.
MEASUREMENTS: The Clinical Global Impression of Change in Apathy scale was used 
as the anchor measure and the MCID on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Apathy 
(NPI-A), Dementia Apathy Interview and Rating (DAIR), and Apathy Evaluation 
Scale-Informant (AES-I) were estimated with linear mixed models across all study 
visits. The estimated thresholds were evaluated with performance metrics.
RESULTS: Among the MCID was a decrease of four points (95% CI: -4.0 to -4.8) on 
the NPI-A, 0.56 points (95% CI: -0.47 to -0.65) on the DAIR, and three points on 
the AES-I (95% CI: -0.9 to -5.4). Distribution-based analyses were largely 
consistent with the anchor-based analyses. The MCID across the three measures 
showed ∼60% accuracy. Sensitivity analyses found that MMSE scores and apathy 
severity at baseline influenced the estimated MCID.
CONCLUSIONS: MCIDs for apathy on three scales will help evaluate treatment 
efficacy at the individual level. However, the modest correspondence between 
MCID and clinical impression of change suggests the need to consider other 
scales.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare and link the total scores of the Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), two common 
global cognitive screeners.
METHODS: 2,325 memory clinic patients (63.2 ± 8.6 years; 43% female) with a 
variety of diagnoses, including subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive 
impairment, and dementia due to various etiologies completed the MMSE and MoCA 
concurrently. We described both screeners, including at the item level. Then, 
using linear regressions, we investigated how age, sex, education, and diagnosis 
affected total scores on both instruments. Next, in linear mixed models, we 
treated the two screeners as repeated measures and analyzed the influence of 
these characteristics on the relationship between the instruments' total scores. 
Finally, we linked total scores using equipercentile equating, accounting for 
relevant patient characteristics.
RESULTS: MMSE scores (mean ± standard deviation: 25.0 ± 4.6) were higher than 
MoCA scores (21.2 ± 5.4), and MMSE items generally showed less variation than 
MoCA items. Both instruments' scores were individually influenced by age, sex, 
education, and diagnosis. The relationship between the screeners was moderated 
by age (estimate = -0.01, 95% confidence interval = [-0.03, -0.00]), education 
(0.14 [0.10, 0.18]), and diagnosis. These were accounted for when producing 
crosswalk tables based on equipercentile equating.
CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for the influence of patient characteristics, we created 
crosswalk tables to convert MMSE scores to MoCA scores, and vice versa. These 
tables may facilitate collaboration between clinicians and researchers and could 
allow larger, pooled analyses of global cognitive functioning in older adults.

AIMS: This study is to investigate the effects of Cannabinoid type 2 receptor 
(CB2R) deficiency on microglia and cognitive function in both Aβ1-42-injected 
CB2R knockout mice and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 
brain.
METHODS: After hippocampal injection with Aβ1-42 oligomers in CB2R knockout mice 
with and without CB2R agonist treatment and in transgenic APP/PS1 mice with CB2R 
deletion, the novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests 
were performed to assess the animal behavior performance. Immunofluorescence 
staining was conducted to detect the microglial morphology and activation 
status. The expression of proinflammation and anti-inflammation cytokines were 
determined by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: CB2R deficiency significantly aggravated cognitive impairment in both 
Aβ1-42-induced and transgenic APP/PS1 animal model in NOR. In Aβ-injected mice 
lacking CB2R and transgenic APP/PS1 mice with CB2R deletion, microglia in the 
prefrontal cortex exhibited enhanced immunoreactivity with altered morphology. 
Furthermore, transformation of activated microglial phenotype in the prefrontal 
cortex was reduced in Aβ1-42-injected CB2R knockout mice after CB2R agonist 
treatment. The CB2R deficiency significantly increased the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines in the prefrontal cortex, while it was observed in the 
hippocampus in both Aβ1-42-injected and transgenic APP/PS1 AD mouse model. 
Furthermore, CB2R deficiency increased concentrations of soluble Aβ 40 in the 
prefrontal cortex, but did not affect plaques deposition.
CONCLUSION: CB2R deletion led to enhanced neuroinflammatory responses via direct 
upregulating microglia activation in the prefrontal cortex during the early 
symptomatic phase of AD mice. CB2R modulates prefrontal cortical 
neuroinflammation, which is essential for regulating cognitive functions such as 
recognition memory at the early stage of AD.

PURPOSE: Exploring the effects of acupuncture at the "Yizhi Tiaoshen" acupoint 
on blood oxygen metabolism and neurological function changes in the brain 
regions of AD model rats.
METHODS: The AD model was replicated by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose 
combined with bilateral hippocampal CA1 injection of Okadaic acid (OA). Thirty 
rats with successfully replicated model were selected through Morris water maze 
experiment and randomly divided into model group, donepezil hydrochloride group, 
and acupuncture group, with 10 rats in each group. After treatment, fNIRs were 
used to detect changes in Oxy Hb, Deoxy Hb, and Total Hb in the cerebral cortex 
of rats in each group, in order to evaluate the neurological function changes in 
key brain areas.
RESULTS: The escape latency of the donepezil hydrochloride group and the 
acupuncture group was shortened, the number of crossings through the original 
platform increased, and the duration of stay in the quadrant where the original 
platform was located was prolonged. Based on fNIRs detection, the main 
differential channels of blood oxygen metabolism in AD rats were identified as 
2-2 and 8-7, corresponding to the prefrontal and parietal lobes, respectively. 
The concentrations of Oxy Hb and Total Hb were significantly increased in both 
treatment groups, while the concentration of Deoxy Hb was significantly 
decreased.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture with the "Yizhi Tiaoshen" acupoint formula and donepezil 
hydrochloride can improve the learning and memory function of AD rats, and its 
mechanism may be related to improving blood oxygen metabolism in the prefrontal 
and parietal regions and protecting neuronal function.

INTRODUCTION: The advent of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) has raised many questions and debates in the field as to the clinical 
benefits, risks, and costs of such therapies. The controversies have resulted in 
the perception that many clinicians are apprehensive about prescribing these 
medications to their patient populations. There also remains widespread 
uncertainty as to the economic impact, cost benefit ratio, and safety oversight 
for use of these medications in standard clinical care settings.
METHODS: To contextualize such issues, the present study compared anti-amyloid 
biologic therapy (lecanemab) to four commonly used biologic agents in other 
fields, including trastuzumab for breast cancer, bevacizumab for lung cancer, 
etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis, and ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis.
RESULTS: The data presented demonstrate comparable costs, clinical benefits, and 
risks for these biologic agents in their disparate disease states.
DISCUSSION: These results provide context for the costs, clinical benefits, and 
safety regarding the mainstream use of anti-amyloid biologic agents for the 
prevention of cognitive loss. While the era of disease-modifying therapies for 
AD is now in its infancy, there is an expectation that these discoveries will be 
followed by improved therapies and combination treatments leading to greater 
efficacy in ameliorating the clinical trajectory of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Anti-amyloid therapy costs are comparable to other commonly used 
biologics.Anti-amyloid therapy efficacy is comparable to other commonly used 
biologics.Anti-amyloid therapy safety is compatible with other commonly used 
biologics.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological 
condition that worsens over time and leads to deterioration in cognitive 
abilities, reduced memory, and, eventually, a decrease in overall functioning. 
Timely and correct identification of Alzheimer's is essential for effective 
treatment. The systematic study specifically examines the application of deep 
learning (DL) algorithms in identifying AD using three-dimensional (3D) imaging 
methods. The main goal is to evaluate these methods' current state, efficiency, 
and potential enhancements, offering valuable insights into how DL could improve 
AD's rapid and precise diagnosis.
METHODS: We searched different online repositories, such as IEEE Xplore, 
Elsevier, MDPI, PubMed Central, Science Direct, ACM, Springer, and others, to 
thoroughly summarize current research on DL methods to diagnose AD by analyzing 
3D imaging data published between 2020 and 2024. We use PRISMA (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to ensure 
the organization and understandability of the information collection process. We 
thoroughly analyzed the literature to determine the primary techniques used in 
these investigations and their findings.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and 
their variations, including 3D CNNs and recurrent neural networks, to detect 
both temporal and spatial characteristics in volumetric data has led to their 
widespread use. Methods such as transfer learning, combining multimodal data, 
and using attention procedures have improved models' precision and reliability. 
We selected 87 articles for evaluation. Out of these, 31 papers included various 
concepts, explanations, and elucidations of models and theories, while the other 
56 papers primarily concentrated on issues related to practical implementation. 
This article introduces popular imaging types, 3D imaging for Alzheimer's 
detection, discusses the benefits and restrictions of the DL-based approach to 
AD assessment, and gives a view toward future developments resulting from 
critical evaluation.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for neurological disease has gained 
traction due to stunning advances in capsid evolution for CNS targeting. With 
AAV brain delivery now in focus, conventional improvements in viral expression 
vectors offer a complementary route for optimizing gene delivery. We previously 
introduced a novel AAV gene therapy to slow amyloid aggregation in the brain 
based on neuronal release of an Aβ sequence variant that inhibited fibrilization 
of wild-type Aβ. Here we explore three coding elements of the virally delivered 
DNA plasmid in an effort to maximize the production of therapeutic peptide in 
the brain. We demonstrate that simply replacing the Gaussia luciferase signal 
peptide with the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain signal peptide increased 
release of variant Aβ by ∼5-fold. Sequence modifications within the expressed 
minigene further increased peptide release by promoting γ-secretase cleavage. 
Addition of a cytosolic fusion tag compatible with γ-secretase interaction 
allowed viral transduction to be tracked by immunostaining, independent from the 
variant Aβ peptide. Collectively these construct modifications increased 
neuronal production of therapeutic peptide by 10-fold upon intracranial AAV 
injection of neonatal mice. These findings demonstrate that modest changes in 
expression vector design can yield substantial gains in AAV efficiency for 
therapeutic applications.

AIMS: The early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are no longer insurmountable. 
Therefore, identifying at-risk individuals is of great importance for precise 
treatment. We developed a model to predict cognitive deterioration in patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database, we constructed models in a derivation cohort of 761 participants with 
MCI (138 of whom developed dementia at the 36th month) and verified them in a 
validation cohort of 353 cognitively normal controls (54 developed MCI and 19 
developed dementia at the 36th month). In addition, 1303 participants with 
available AD cerebrospinal fluid core biomarkers were selected to clarify the 
ability of the model to predict AD core features. We assessed 32 parameters as 
candidate predictors, including clinical information, blood biomarkers, and 
structural imaging features, and used multivariable logistic regression analysis 
to develop our prediction model.
RESULTS: Six independent variables of MCI deterioration were identified: 
apolipoprotein E ε4 allele status, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, 
higher levels of plasma pTau181, smaller volumes of the left hippocampus and 
right amygdala, and a thinner right inferior temporal cortex. We established an 
easy-to-use risk heat map and risk score based on these risk factors. The area 
under the curve (AUC) for both internal and external validations was close to 
0.850. Furthermore, the AUC was above 0.800 in identifying participants with 
high brain amyloid-β loads. Calibration plots demonstrated good agreement 
between the predicted probability and actual observations in the internal and 
external validations.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated an accurate prediction model for dementia 
conversion in patients with MCI. Simultaneously, the model predicts AD-specific 
pathological changes. We hope that this model will contribute to more precise 
clinical treatment and better healthcare resource allocation.

BACKGROUND: Previous research on the risk of dementia associated with education 
attainment, smoking status, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) has yielded 
inconsistent results, indicating potential heterogeneous treatment effects 
(HTEs) of these factors on dementia risk. Thus, this study aimed to identify the 
important variables that may contribute to HTEs of these factors in older 
adults.
METHODS: Using 2005-2021 data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 
(NACC), we included older adults (≥ 65 years) with normal cognition at the first 
visit. The exposure of interest included college education or above, current 
smoking, and AUD and the outcome was all-cause dementia. We applied doubly 
robust learning to estimate risk differences (RD) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) between exposed and unexposed groups in the overall cohort and subgroups 
identified through a decision tree model.
RESULTS: Of 10,062 participants included, 929 developed all-cause dementia over 
a median 4.4-year follow-up. College education or above was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause dementia in the overall population (RD, -1.5%; 95%CI, 
-2.8 to -0.3), especially among the subpopulations without hypertension, 
regardless of the APOE4 status. Current smoking was not related to increased 
dementia risk overall (2.8%; -1.5 to 7.2) but was significantly associated with 
increased dementia risk among men with (21.1%, 3.1 to 39.1) and without (8.4%, 
0.9 to 15.8) cerebrovascular disease. AUD was not related to increased dementia 
risk overall (2.0%; -7.7 to 11.7) but was significantly associated with 
increased dementia risk among men with neuropsychiatric disorders (31.5%; 7.4 to 
55.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies identified important factors contributing to HTEs of 
education, smoking, and AUD on risk of all-cause dementia, suggesting an 
individualized approach is needed to address dementia disparities.

Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic 
Alzheimer's disease, is also a risk factor for microvascular pathologies leading 
to cognitive impairment, particularly subcortical white matter injury. These 
effects have been attributed to alterations in the regulation of the brain blood 
supply, but the cellular source of ApoE4 and the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. In mice expressing human ApoE3 or ApoE4, we report that 
border-associated macrophages (BAMs), myeloid cells closely apposed to 
neocortical microvessels, are both sources and effectors of ApoE4 mediating the 
neurovascular dysfunction through reactive oxygen species. ApoE4 in BAMs is 
solely responsible for the increased susceptibility to oligemic white matter 
damage in ApoE4 mice and is sufficient to enhance damage in ApoE3 mice. The data 
unveil a new aspect of BAM pathobiology and highlight a previously unrecognized 
cell-autonomous role of BAM in the neurovascular dysfunction of ApoE4 with 
potential therapeutic implications.

Functional connectivity patterns in the human brain, like the friction ridges of 
a fingerprint, can uniquely identify individuals. Does this "brain fingerprint" 
remain distinct even during Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Using fMRI data from 
healthy and pathologically ageing subjects, we find that individual functional 
connectivity profiles remain unique and highly heterogeneous during mild 
cognitive impairment and AD. However, the patterns that make individuals 
identifiable change with disease progression, revealing a reconfiguration of the 
brain fingerprint. Notably, connectivity shifts towards functional system 
connections in AD and lower-order cognitive functions in early disease stages. 
These findings emphasize the importance of focusing on individual variability 
rather than group differences in AD studies. Individual functional connectomes 
could be instrumental in creating personalized models of AD progression, 
predicting disease course, and optimizing treatments, paving the way for 
personalized medicine in AD management.

The TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) has been implicated in the pathogenesis 
of human neurodegenerative diseases and exhibits hallmark neuropathology in 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we explore its tractability as a 
plasma biomarker of disease and describe its localization and possible functions 
in the cytosol of platelets. Novel TDP-43 immunoassays were developed on three 
different technical platforms and qualified for specificity, signal-to-noise 
ratio, detection range, variation, spike recovery and dilution linearity in 
human plasma samples. Surprisingly, implementation of these assays demonstrated 
that biobank-archived plasma samples yielded considerable heterogeneity in 
TDP-43 levels. Importantly, subsequent investigation attributed these 
differences to variable platelet recovery. Fractionations of fresh blood 
revealed that ≥ 95% of the TDP-43 in platelet-containing plasma was 
compartmentalized within the platelet cytosol. We reasoned that this highly 
concentrated source of TDP-43 comprised an interesting substrate for biochemical 
analyses. Additional characterization of platelets revealed the presence of the 
disease-associated phosphoserine 409/410 TDP-43 proteoform and many neuron- and 
astrocyte-expressed TDP-43 mRNA targets. Considering these striking 
similarities, we propose that TDP-43 may serve analogous functional roles in 
platelets and synapses, and that the study of platelet TDP-43 might provide a 
window into disease-related TDP-43 dyshomeostasis in the central nervous system.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge in neurodegenerative 
research and clinical practice due to its complex etiology and progressive 
nature. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognostic modelling of AD holds promising potential to transform 
the landscape of dementia care. This review explores recent advancements in AI 
applications across various stages of AD management. In early diagnosis, 
AI-enhanced neuroimaging techniques, including MRI, PET, and CT scans, enable 
precise detection of AD biomarkers. Machine learning models analyze these images 
to identify patterns indicative of early cognitive decline. Additionally, AI 
algorithms are employed to detect genetic and proteomic biomarkers, facilitating 
early intervention. Cognitive and behavioral assessments have also benefited 
from AI, with tools that enhance the accuracy of neuropsychological tests and 
analyze speech and language patterns for early signs of dementia. Personalized 
treatment strategies have been revolutionized by AI-driven approaches. In drug 
discovery, virtual screening and drug repurposing, guided by predictive 
modelling, accelerate the identification of effective treatments. AI also aids 
in tailoring therapeutic interventions by predicting individual responses to 
treatments and monitoring patient progress, allowing for dynamic adjustment of 
care plans. Prognostic modelling, another critical area, utilizes AI to predict 
disease progression through longitudinal data analysis and risk prediction 
models. The integration of multi-modal data, combining clinical, genetic, and 
imaging information, enhances the accuracy of these predictions. Deep learning 
techniques are particularly effective in fusing diverse data types to uncover 
new insights into disease mechanisms and progression. Despite these 
advancements, challenges remain, including ethical considerations, data privacy, 
and the need for seamless integration of AI tools into clinical workflows. This 
review underscores the transformative potential of AI in AD management while 
highlighting areas for future research and development. By leveraging AI, the 
healthcare community can improve early diagnosis, personalize treatments, and 
predict disease outcomes more accurately, ultimately enhancing the quality of 
life for individuals with AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is 
characterized by the aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau in the brain. 
Breakthroughs in disease-modifying treatments targeting Aβ bring new hope for 
the management of AD. But to effectively modify and someday even prevent AD, a 
better understanding is needed of the biological mechanisms that underlie and 
link Aβ and tau in AD. Developments of high-throughput omics, including 
genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, together with molecular imaging of Aβ 
and tau with positron emission tomography (PET), allow us to discover and 
understand the biological pathways that regulate the aggregation and spread of 
Aβ and tau in living humans. The field of integrated omics and PET studies of Aβ 
and tau in AD is growing rapidly. We here provide an update of this field, both 
in terms of biological insights and in terms of future clinical implications of 
integrated omics-molecular imaging studies.

BACKGROUND: Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an inflammatory and 
neurodegenerative disease. After two or more short courses of alemtuzumab (ALZ), 
an immune reconstitution is achieved, which long-term results in reduced disease 
activity. We aimed to investigate the effect of ALZ on measures of 
neurodegeneration (i.e., brain atrophy, and retinal layer thinning).
METHODS: We designed an observational prospective mono-center study in RRMS 
patients initiating ALZ treatment. Patients were assessed at baseline (month 0) 
and thereafter annually for five years with clinical measures, synthetic 
magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), with 
a re-baseline SyMRI scan and an OCT exam 24 months after initiating ALZ. Persons 
with neurological symptoms but without evidence of neurological disease served 
as symptomatic controls (SCs, n = 27).
RESULTS: Forty-nine RRMS patients were included. Baseline median expanded 
disability status scale [2.0 (IQR 1.5)] was unchanged during follow-up, 71 % 
were progression-free, 33 % achieved no evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3). 
Between baseline and month 60, SyMRI showed a reduction of brain parenchymal 
fraction (BPF) and grey matter (GM) volume in patients. The BPF reduction was 
greater in RRMS patients than in SCs (p < 0.05), and more pronounced in patients 
with high pre-baseline disease activity than in those without (p < 0.01). OCT 
showed significant thinning of macular ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers 
(mGCIPL) and in peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) in patients. In 
contrast, absolute values of white matter (WM) volume and myelin content (MyC) 
quantified by SyMRI, were stable or increased after re-baseline (month 24) and 
up to month 60, and this increase appeared limited to patients without high 
pre-baseline disease activity and to patients with NEDA-3 or disability 
worsening during follow-up. A strong positive correlation between WM volume and 
GM volume at baseline was lost after ALZ intervention for their delta values, 
i.e., change from re-baseline (month 24) to month 60. While the positive 
baseline correlation between WM volume and MyC increased for their delta values, 
the positive baseline correlation between GM volume and MyC changed to negative 
for their delta values.
CONCLUSION: We showed that neurodegeneration continued in RRMS patients under 
ALZ treatment, but it appeared to be limited to BPF and GM, and more pronounced 
in patients with disease activity. Our data suggest that patients who respond to 
ALZ treatment show signs of remyelination. OCT and SyMRI have potential to 
quantify measures of neurodegeneration that is affected by treatment 
intervention in RRMS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite the mechanistic potential of sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) to improve neurologic outcomes, the efficacy 
of SGLT2i in neurodegenerative disorders among patients with type 2 diabetes is 
not well established. This population-based cohort study aimed to investigate 
the association of SGLT2i use with risks of incident dementia and Parkinson 
disease (PD) in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: This was a retrospective examination of data from a cohort of 1,348,362 
participants with type 2 diabetes (≥40 years), who started antidiabetic drugs 
from 2014 to 2019, evaluated using the Korean National Health Insurance Service 
Database. Propensity score matching (1:1; SGLT2i to other oral antidiabetic 
drugs [OADs]) produced a cohort of 358,862 participants. Primary outcomes were 
the individual incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and 
PD. Secondary outcomes were all-cause dementia (AD, VaD, and other dementia) and 
a composite of all-cause dementia and PD. Cox proportional hazards models were 
used to investigate the association between SGLT2i use and the risks of dementia 
and PD.
RESULTS: From the 358,862 participants analyzed (mean [SD] age, 57.8 [9.6] 
years; 58.0% male), 6,837 incident dementia or PD events occurred. Regarding the 
individual endpoints, SGLT2i use was associated with reduced risks of AD 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.87), VaD (aHR 0.69, 95% CI 
0.60-0.78), and PD (aHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.91) with a 6-month drug use lag 
period. In addition, use of SGLT2i was associated with a 21% lower risk of 
all-cause dementia (aHR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90) and a 22% lower risk of 
all-cause dementia and PD than use of other OADs (aHR 0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.83). 
The association between the use of SGLT2i and the lowered risk of these 
neurodegenerative disorders was not affected by sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 
diabetic complications, comorbidities, and medications. Sensitivity analysis 
further adjusting for bioclinical variables from health screening tests, 
including blood pressure, glucose, lipid profiles, and kidney function, yielded 
generally consistent results.
DISCUSSION: In this nationwide population-based study, SGLT2i use significantly 
reduced the risks of neurodegenerative disorders in patients with type 2 
diabetes independent of various factors including comorbidities and bioclinical 
parameters.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that SGLT2 
antidiabetic drugs decrease the risk of dementia and PD in people with diabetes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diet may influence the development of cognitive 
impairment and affect cognitive decline, but whether this relationship varies 
between Black American and White American people is unclear. This study examined 
the association of Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 
Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) and incident cognitive 
impairment and cognitive trajectories in a biracial prospective cohort study.
METHODS: Using data derived from the Food Frequency Questionnaire in the REasons 
for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study, we compared MIND diet 
adherence with incident cognitive impairment and cognitive trajectory in Black 
participants and White participants. Logistic regression was used to model MIND 
diet score (continuous variable and using tertiles) and incident cognitive 
impairment after adjusting for age, sex, race, region, education, income, total 
energy, hypertension history, dyslipidemia, diabetes, estimated glomerular 
filtration rate, ischemic heart conditions, atrial fibrillation, and lifestyle 
factors including sedentary, obesity, and smoking. Mixed-effects models were 
used to examine the association between cognitive trajectory and MIND diet 
adherence.
RESULTS: Dietary data to calculate the MIND diet score and cognitive data were 
available on 14,145 participants with a mean age of 64 years (SD 9.0 years) that 
was 56.7% female. Greater MIND diet adherence was associated with a decreased 
incidence of cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99, p = 
0.02) after adjusting for all covariates. In the fully adjusted model, greater 
MIND diet adherence was associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment 
in female participants (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.96, p < 0.001) but not in male 
participants (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.06, p = 0.64). In all models, greater MIND 
diet adherence was associated with decreased risk of cognitive decline. MIND 
diet adherence was a better predictor of cognitive decline in Black participants 
(β = 0.04, SE = 0.007, p < 0.001) than in White participants (β = 0.03, SE = 
0.004, p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Greater MIND diet adherence was associated with decreased risk of 
cognitive impairment in female participants but not male participants, with no 
difference between Black participants and White participants. However, MIND diet 
adherence was a better predictor of cognitive trajectory in Black participants 
than in White participants.

INTRODUCTION: The goal of this economic model is to estimate an economically 
justifiable price (EJP) for using donanemab for the treatment of early 
symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States based on clinical data 
from the phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial (NCT04437511).
METHODS: We adapted an AD Markov state-transition model developed by the 
Institute for Clinical and Economic Review to estimate the EJP for donanemab at 
different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds from the health care system 
perspective and the societal perspective as co-base cases.
RESULTS: Assuming a WTP threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained, the model estimates a 1-year (13-dose) EJP for donanemab of 
$80,538 from the health care system perspective and $91,126 from the societal 
perspective; at a WTP threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained, the model estimates 
a 1-year (13-dose) EJP for donanemab of $44,691 from the health care system 
perspective and $55,419 from the societal perspective. Mean total treatment 
costs per patient at the $150,000 per QALY gained EJP derived from the health 
care system perspective were estimated at $77,812 based on the average number of 
doses of donanemab patients received in the co-base case analysis. One-way 
sensitivity analysis (OWSA) indicated that treatment efficacy, disease severity 
at the time of treatment initiation, and duration of treatment effect were the 
main drivers of the potential EJP.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this modeling simulation informed by the 
TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study support an EJP for limited-duration treatment with 
donanemab that exceeds per-dose list prices for currently available 
amyloid-targeting therapies, implying potentially lower lifetime costs and 
better value for money.

PURPOSE: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been diagnosed in 91.7% of 
retired United States National Football League (NFL) players at postmortem. 
There is no treatment or cure for CTE. Most living former NFL athletes with 
probable CTE suffer from obesity and its comorbidities. Our previous reviews 
document the improvement in cognition following metabolic/bariatric surgery 
(MBS) (e.g., gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy). These operations might reduce 
microglial maladaptive states, thereby attenuating neurodegeneration and 
CTE-like neurocognitive impairment. The study evaluated former NFL players' 
views on metabolic surgery in relation to reduction of obesity and CTE risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online multiple-choice questionnaire (30 items, 125 
response options, 10-min completion) developed in the Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) system was sent to 1,014 athletes screened in 2017-2022 by the 
Living Heart Foundation.
RESULTS: From 2/2022 to 7/2023, of 700 surveys opened, 72 (10.3%) of the retired 
players responded. Mean age was 61.6 ± 12.6 years; 45.0% had the disease of 
obesity with a mean BMI 35.5 ± 4.6 kg/m2. Thirty-three percent reported ≥ 2 
obesity-related comorbidities; 40.3% memory-related TBI symptoms; 66.7% ≥ 1 
cognitive symptom; 85.0% believed MBS was safe and effective but were unlikely 
to elect MBS for weight management. Yet, 57.0% of the entire cohort, and 68.8% 
of players with obesity were more likely to elect MBS if it could also reduce 
CTE risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study bode well for future research recruitment. 
Most surveyed retired NFL players with obesity believed MBS to be effective and 
would be more likely to undergo MBS if it also reduced CTE risk.

Neurons are the primary cells responsible for information processing in the 
central nervous system (CNS). However, they are vulnerable to damage and insult 
in a variety of neurological disorders. As the most abundant glial cells in the 
brain, astrocytes provide crucial support to neurons and participate in synapse 
formation, synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter recycling, regulation of 
metabolic processes, and the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier integrity. 
Though astrocytes play a significant role in the manifestation of injury and 
disease, they do not work in isolation. Cellular interactions between astrocytes 
and neurons are essential for maintaining the homeostasis of the CNS under both 
physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we explore the 
diverse interactions between astrocytes and neurons under physiological 
conditions, including the exchange of neurotrophic factors, gliotransmitters, 
and energy substrates, and different CNS diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. 
This review sheds light on the contribution of astrocyte-neuron crosstalk to the 
progression of neurological diseases to provide potential therapeutic targets 
for the treatment of neurological diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia worldwide. 
Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-beta, became the first 
disease-modifying treatment for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and mild AD dementia and suggested that removing amyloid from the 
brain, especially in early AD, might make a difference in slowing cognitive 
decline.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors outline aducanumab's clinical 
efficacy as shown through key clinical trials and discuss its approval by the 
Food and Drug Administration under the accelerated pathway, which sparked both 
hope and controversy. We also discuss the importance of amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities as a major side effect of aducanumab and all subsequent monoclonal 
antibodies targeting amyloid-beta.
EXPERT OPINION: Aducanumab, became the first monoclonal antibody that provided 
at least partial support for the amyloid hypothesis by demonstrating slowed 
cognitive decline by removing amyloid from the brain, although full FDA approval 
now seems unlikely due to discontinuation of its development. Its introduction 
raised awareness of ARIA, highlighted the significant costs and need for 
informed consent in treatment, and emphasized the importance of long-term, 
diverse, and combination therapy data for future AD treatments targeting amyloid 
and tau.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Conventional diagnostic 
methods, such as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, typically detect 
AD at advanced stages, limiting the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Early 
detection is crucial for improving patient condition by enabling timely 
administration of treatments that may decelerate disease progression. In this 
context, single-atom catalysts (SACs) and single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) have 
emerged as promising tools offering highly sensitive and selective detection of 
Alzheimer's biomarkers. SACs, consisting of isolated metal atoms on a support 
surface, deliver unparalleled atomic efficiency, increased reactivity, and 
reduced operational costs, although certain challenges in terms of stability, 
aggregation, and other factors persist. The advent of SAzymes, which integrate 
SACs with natural metalloprotease catalysts, has further advanced this field by 
enabling controlled electronic exchange, synergistic productivity, and enhanced 
biosafety. Particularly, M-N-C SACs with M-Nx active sites mimic the selectivity 
and sensitivity of natural metalloenzymes, providing a robust platform for early 
detection of AD. This review encompasses the advancements in SACs and SAzymes, 
highlighting their pivotal role in bridging the gap between conventional enzymes 
and nanozyme and offering enhanced catalytic efficiency, controlled electron 
transfer, and improved biosafety for Alzheimer's detection.

INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in gene expression 
regulation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.
METHODS: We investigated the association between baseline plasma miRNAs and 
central AD biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI; N = 803): amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N). Differentially 
expressed miRNAs and their targets were identified, followed by pathway 
enrichment analysis. Machine learning approaches were applied to investigate the 
role of miRNAs as blood biomarkers.
RESULTS: We identified nine, two, and eight miRNAs significantly associated with 
A/T/N positivity, respectively. We identified 271 genes targeted by 
amyloid-related miRNAs with estrogen signaling receptor-mediated signaling among 
the enriched pathways. Additionally, 220 genes targeted by 
neurodegeneration-related miRNAs showed enrichment in pathways including the 
insulin growth factor 1 pathway. The classification performance of demographic 
information for A/T/N positivity was increased up to 9% with the inclusion of 
miRNAs.
DISCUSSION: Plasma miRNAs were associated with central A/T/N biomarkers, 
highlighting their potential as blood biomarkers.
HIGHLIGHTS: We performed association analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) with 
amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarker positivity. We identified 
dysregulated miRNAs for A/T/N biomarker positivity. We identified Alzheimer's 
disease biomarker-specific/common pathways related to miRNAs. miRNAs improved 
the classification for A/T/N positivity by up to 9%. Our study highlights the 
potential of miRNAs as blood biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ApHCM) is a variant of 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with distinct clinical characteristics and 
outcomes. We aimed to clarify the natural history of patients with ApHCM and 
identify the risk of end-stage heart failure incidence.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study was conducted on patients with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in China between January 2009 and February 2024. 
Patients were stratified into ApHCM and non-ApHCM groups. The primary outcome 
was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, including all-cause 
deaths, heart failure hospitalization, sudden cardiac death, and ventricular 
tachycardia. The secondary outcome was the incidence of end-stage heart failure, 
defined as left ventricular ejection fraction <50%. Kaplan-Meier and univariable 
and multivariable Cox proportional analyses were applied. Adjustment variables 
were included for important baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and 
medication use. Of 5653 patients enrolled with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 584 
(10.3%) had ApHCM and 5069 (89.7%) had non-ApHCM. During the median follow-up 
period of 4.6 years (1.6-8.0 years), major adverse cardiovascular events 
occurred in 32.2% (n=1808), with a lower incidence in patients with ApHCM than 
non-ApHCM (20.4% versus 33.3%, P<0.001). Non-ApHCM was an independent predictor 
of major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65 [95% CI, 
1.36-1.99]; P<0.001). In the serial cohort, patients with ApHCM exhibited a 
lower incidence of end-stage heart failure than those with non-ApHCM (12.4% 
versus 2.7%, P<0.001). Non-ApHCM was associated with a higher risk of end-stage 
heart failure development (HR, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.28-4.15]; P<0.001). In subgroup 
and sensitivity analysis, the results were consistent for our main and secondary 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: ApHCM is relatively common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and shows 
lower rates of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations than 
non-ApHCM.

OBJECTIVE: Anxiety is a common comorbid feature of late-life depression (LLD) 
and is associated with poorer global cognitive functioning independent of 
depression severity. However, little is known about whether comorbid anxiety is 
associated with a domain-specific pattern of cognitive dysfunction. We therefore 
examined group differences (LLD with and without comorbid anxiety) in cognitive 
functioning performance across multiple domains.
METHOD: Older adults with major depressive disorder (N = 228, ages 65-91) were 
evaluated for anxiety and depression severity, and cognitive functioning 
(learning, memory, language, processing speed, executive functioning, working 
memory, and visuospatial functioning). Ordinary least squares regression 
adjusting for age, sex, education, and concurrent depression severity examined 
anxiety group differences in performance on tests of cognitive functioning.
RESULTS: Significant group differences emerged for confrontation naming and 
visuospatial functioning, as well as for verbal fluency, working memory, and 
inhibition with lower performance for LLD with comorbid anxiety compared to LLD 
only, controlling for depression severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Performance patterns identified among older adults with LLD and 
comorbid anxiety resemble neuropsychological profiles typically seen in 
neurodegenerative diseases of aging. These findings have potential implications 
for etiological considerations in the interpretation of neuropsychological 
profiles.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of cognition and a 
gradual decrease in memory. Although AD is considered the most persistent form 
of dementia and a global concern, no complete cure or agents that can completely 
halt the progression of AD have been found. In the past years, significant 
progress has been made in understanding the cellular and molecular changes 
associated with AD, and numerous drug targets have been identified for the 
development of drugs for this disease. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are the major attributes of AD. Symptomatic relief 
is the only possible treatment available at present and a disease-modifying drug 
is of utmost importance. The development of drugs that can inhibit different 
targets responsible for the formation of plaques is a potential area in AD 
research. This review is not a complete list of all possible targets for AD but 
serves to highlight the targets related to Aβ pathology and pathways concerned 
with the formation of Aβ fragments. This shall serve as a prospect in the 
identification of Aβ plaque inhibitors and pave the strategies for newer drug 
treatments. Nevertheless, substantial research is done in this area but to 
bridle, the clinical difficulty remains a concern.

A Role-Needs Framework: Rethinking Support for Informal Caregivers for 
Alzheimer's Across the Global South and Global North.

OBJECTIVE: Caregivers play an essential role in supporting people with 
Alzheimer's disease globally. User-informed research is vital to developing 
trans-cultural guidelines for dementia support organisations. While coping 
strategies of caregivers are well researched, the 'coping-effectiveness' 
framework falls short of representing all caregiver needs. Our aim was to 
develop a robust and inclusive, globally applicable framework of 
caregiver-informed support needs.
METHODS: In partnership with Alzheimer's Disease International and Roche, we 
conducted qualitative online semi-structured interviews with 34 family 
caregivers from the Global North (UK, US) and Global South (Brazil, South 
Africa) in the COVID-19 context. Participant-generated photographs helped 
encourage discussions of hidden contextual issues. Iterative inductive narrative 
analysis of interviews and photographs was carried out with input from global 
and national charity and industry sectors.
RESULTS: We identified a framework of four cross-cultural caring approaches with 
implications for support: (1) Empathising, using emotion-focused strategies to 
develop strong expertise and coping skills, with time specific information, 
psychosocial and peer support needs. (2) Organising, using problem-focused 
strategies, with strong narratives of expertise and advocacy which benefited 
from early structured information and professional confirmation. (3) 
Non-identifying caregiving, where daily aspects of caring occurred without 
specialist knowledge and expertise, and caregivers sought assistance in managing 
disease-related support. (4) Reluctance, where struggling with unwanted caring 
responsibilities meant caregivers looked to professionals to carry out daily 
care.
CONCLUSION: Our findings move beyond the 'coping-effectiveness' framework of 
support to suggest a novel 'role-needs' framework. Our approach supports 
inclusive ways of tailoring support to fit individual caregiver circumstances 
globally.

Clinical Update on an Anti-Alzheimer Drug Candidate CT1812: A Sigma-2 Receptor 
Antagonist.

PURPOSE: This review article summarizes the progress and latest findings related 
to the investigational drug candidate CT1812, which is currently in phase 2 
clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The article outlines the 
development of this promising molecule and provides insights into its mechanism 
of action as sigma-2 receptor (S2R) antagonist along with the positive outcomes 
of various clinical trials. Literature mentioning AD therapeutics that 
specifically target amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers is limited even though these 
oligomers are established as the most neurotoxic forms of the Aβ protein. This 
timely article highlights the potential of CT1812 as a breakthrough in AD 
therapeutics, providing a new avenue for addressing the neurotoxic forms of Aβ 
and advancing the field toward a potential cure for AD.
METHODS: The literature includes articles searched from PubMed and Google 
Scholar along with a comprehensive discussion of all the clinical research 
trials undertaken for CT1812. The review includes 12 clinical trials; of the 
total citations identified, 10 have been used to support the results of 
published trials.
FINDINGS: The positive outcomes in the multiple clinical trials conducted on 
CT1812 indicate the emergence of an effective and promising drug candidate for 
AD. The article mentions a gap in the literature regarding AD therapeutics 
specifically targeting Aβ oligomers, which reveals lack of established 
treatments addressing Aβ oligomers, making the novel approach of CT1812 
noteworthy.
IMPLICATIONS: Clinical treatments available today provide symptomatic relief, 
however, any drug providing a potential cure for AD remains an unanswered 
question. S2Rs mediated oligomer binding in addition to synaptic toxicity 
suggest the potential usefulness of CT1812 in AD treatment. Efficacy and safety 
of CT1812 in further clinical trials could represent a significant advancement 
in the field, offering a potential treatment that goes beyond the symptomatic 
relief and aimed at addressing the core mechanisms associated with AD.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a well-established biomarker of 
reactive astrogliosis in the central nervous system because of its elevated 
levels following brain injury and various neurological disorders. The advent of 
ultra-sensitive methods for measuring low-abundant proteins has significantly 
enhanced our understanding of GFAP levels in the serum or plasma of patients 
with diverse neurological diseases. Clinical studies have demonstrated that GFAP 
holds promise both as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, including but not 
limited to individuals with Alzheimer's disease. GFAP exhibits diverse forms and 
structures, herein referred to as its proteoform complexity, encompassing 
conformational dynamics, isoforms and post-translational modifications (PTMs). 
In this review, we explore how the proteoform complexity of GFAP influences its 
detection, which may affect the differential diagnostic performance of GFAP in 
different biological fluids and can provide valuable insights into underlying 
biological processes. Additionally, proteoforms are often disease-specific, and 
our review provides suggestions and highlights areas to focus on for the 
development of new assays for measuring GFAP, including isoforms, PTMs, 
discharge mechanisms, breakdown products, higher-order species and interacting 
partners. By addressing the knowledge gaps highlighted in this review, we aim to 
support the clinical translation and interpretation of GFAP in both CSF and 
blood and the development of reliable, reproducible and specific prognostic and 
diagnostic tests. To enhance disease pathology comprehension and optimise GFAP 
as a biomarker, a thorough understanding of detected proteoforms in biofluids is 
essential.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in older 
people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). No biomarkers to 
detect the related pathology or predict the clinical evolution of NPS are 
available yet. This study aimed to identify plasma proteins that may serve as 
biomarkers for NPS and NPS-related clinical disease progression.
METHODS: A panel of 190 plasma proteins was quantified using Luminex xMAP in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. NPS and cognitive 
performance were assessed at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. Logistic 
regression, receiver operating characteristic analysis and cross-validation were 
used to address the relations of interest.
RESULTS: A total of 507 participants with mild cognitive impairment (n=396) or 
mild AD dementia (n=111) were considered. Selected plasma proteins improved the 
prediction of NPS (area under the curve (AUC) from 0.61 to 0.76, p<0.001) and 
future NPS (AUC from 0.63 to 0.80, p<0.001) when added to a reference model. 
Distinct protein panels were identified for single symptoms. Among the selected 
proteins, ANGT, CCL1 and IL3 were associated with NPS at all three time points 
while CCL1, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and complement factor H were 
also associated with cognitive decline. The associations were independent of the 
presence of cerebral AD pathology as assessed using cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma proteins are associated with NPS and improve prediction of 
future NPS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular risk factors (VRFs) and cerebral small 
vessel disease (cSVD) are common in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). It 
remains unclear whether this coexistence reflects shared risk factors or a 
mechanistic relationship and whether vascular and amyloid pathologies have 
independent or synergistic influence on subsequent AD pathophysiology in 
preclinical stages. We investigated links between VRFs, cSVD, and amyloid levels 
(Aβ1-42) and their combined effect on downstream AD biomarkers, that is, CSF 
hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau181), atrophy, and cognition.
METHODS: This retrospective study included nondemented participants (Clinical 
Dementia Rating < 1) from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) 
cohort and assessed VRFs with the Framingham risk score (FRS) and cSVD features 
on MRI using visual scales and white matter hyperintensity volumes. After 
preliminary linear analysis, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to 
create a "cSVD severity" latent variable and assess the direct and indirect 
effects of FRS and cSVD severity on Aβ1-42, P-tau181, gray matter volume 
(baseline and longitudinal), and cognitive performance (baseline and 
longitudinal).
RESULTS: A total cohort of 1,592 participants were evaluated (mean age = 65.5 ± 
7.4 years; 56.16% F). We observed positive associations between FRS and all cSVD 
features (all p < 0.05) and a negative association between FRS and Aβ1-42 (β = 
-0.04 ± 0.01). All cSVD features were negatively associated with CSF Aβ1-42 (all 
p < 0.05). Using SEM, the cSVD severity fully mediated the association between 
FRS and CSF Aβ1-42 (indirect effect: β = -0.03 ± 0.01), also when omitting 
vascular amyloid-related markers. We observed a significant indirect effect of 
cSVD severity on P-tau181 (indirect effect: β = 0.12 ± 0.03), baseline and 
longitudinal gray matter volume (indirect effect: β = -0.10 ± 0.03; β = -0.12 ± 
0.05), and baseline cognitive performance (indirect effect: β = -0.16 ± 0.03) 
through CSF Aβ1-42.
DISCUSSION: In a large nondemented population, our findings suggest that cSVD is 
a mediator of the relationship between VRFs and CSF Aβ1-42 and affects 
downstream neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. We provide evidence of 
VRFs indirectly affecting the pathogenesis of AD, highlighting the importance of 
considering cSVD burden in memory clinics for AD risk evaluation and as an early 
window for intervention. These results stress the role of VRFs and 
cerebrovascular pathology as key biomarkers for accurate design of anti-amyloid 
clinical trials and offer new perspectives for patient stratification.

Tryptophan Metabolism in Obesity: The Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase-1 Activity and 
Therapeutic Options.

Obesity activates both innate and adaptive immune responses in adipose tissue. 
Adipose tissue macrophages are functional antigen-presenting cells that promote 
the proliferation of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-producing cluster of 
differentiation (CD)4+ T cells in adipose tissue of obese subjects. The 
increased formation of neopterin and degradation of tryptophan may result in 
decreased T-cell responsiveness and lead to immunodeficiency. The activity of 
inducible indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) plays a major role in 
pro-inflammatory, IFN-γ-dominated settings. The expression of several kynurenine 
pathway enzyme genes is significantly increased in obesity. IDO1 in obesity 
shifts tryptophan metabolism from serotonin and melatonin synthesis to the 
formation of kynurenines and increases the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan as 
well as with neopterin production. Reduction in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 
5-HT) production provokes satiety dysregulation that leads to increased caloric 
uptake and obesity. According to the monoamine-deficiency hypothesis, a 
deficiency of cerebral serotonin is involved in neuropsychiatric symptomatology 
of depression, mania, and psychosis. Indeed, bipolar disorder (BD) and related 
cognitive deficits are accompanied by a higher prevalence of overweight and 
obesity. Furthermore, the accumulation of amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease 
brains has several toxic effects as well as IDO induction. Hence, abdominal 
obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction. kynurenines and 
their ratios are prognostic parameters in coronary artery disease. Increased 
kynurenine/tryptophan ratio correlates with increased intima-media thickness and 
represents advanced atherosclerosis. However, after bariatric surgery, weight 
reduction does not lead to the normalization of IDO1 activity and 
atherosclerosis. IDO1 is involved in the mechanisms of immune tolerance and in 
the concept of tumor immuno-editing process in cancer development. Serum IDO1 
activity is still used as a parameter in cancer development and growth. 
IDO-producing tumors show a high total IDO immunostaining score, and thus, using 
IDO inhibitors, such as Epacadostat, Navoximod, and L isomer of 
1-methyl-tryptophan, seems an important modality for cancer treatment. There is 
an inverse correlation between serum folate concentration and body mass index, 
thus folate deficiency leads to hyperhomocysteinemia-induced oxidative stress. 
Immune checkpoint blockade targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 
synergizes with imatinib, which is an inhibitor of mitochondrial folate-mediated 
one-carbon (1C) metabolism. Antitumor effects of imatinib are enhanced by 
increasing T-cell effector function in the presence of IDO inhibition. Combining 
IDO targeting with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or immunotherapy, may be an 
effective tool against a wide range of malignancies. However, there are some 
controversial results regarding the efficacy of IDO1 inhibitors in cancer 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Despite considerable heritability, previous smaller genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) have not identified any robust genetic risk factors 
for isolated dystonia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to perform a large-scale GWAS in a 
well-characterized, multicenter sample of >6000 individuals to identify genetic 
risk factors for isolated dystonia.
METHODS: Array-based GWASs were performed on autosomes for 4303 dystonia 
participants and 2362 healthy control subjects of European ancestry with 
subgroup analysis based on age at onset, affected body regions, and a newly 
developed clinical score. Another 736 individuals were used for validation.
RESULTS: This GWAS identified no common genome-wide significant loci that could 
be replicated despite sufficient power to detect meaningful effects. Power 
analyses imply that the effects of individual variants are likely very small.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability 
indicates that common variants do not contribute to isolated dystonia in this 
cohort. Sequence-based GWASs (eg, by whole-genome sequencing) might help to 
better understand the genetic basis. © 2024 The Author(s). Movement Disorders

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the 2024 Alzheimer's 
Association Workgroup's integrated clinical-biological staging scheme in 
outpatient settings within a tertiary memory clinic.
METHODS: The 2018 syndromal cognitive staging system, coupled with a binary 
biomarker classification, was implemented for 236 outpatients with cognitive 
concerns. The 2024 numeric clinical staging framework, incorporating biomarker 
staging, was specifically applied to 154 individuals within the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) continuum.
RESULTS: The 2024 staging scheme accurately classified 95.5% AD. Among these, 
56.5% exhibited concordant clinical and biological stages (canonical), 34.7% 
demonstrated more advanced clinical stages than biologically expected 
(susceptible), and 8.8% displayed the inverse pattern (resilient). The 
susceptible group was characterized by a higher burden of neurodegeneration and 
inflammation than anticipated from tau, whereas the resilient group showed the 
opposite.
DISCUSSION: The 2024 staging scheme is generally feasible. A discrepancy between 
clinical and biological stages is relatively frequent among symptomatic patients 
with AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The 2024 AA staging scheme is generally feasible in a tertiary 
memory clinic. A discrepancy between clinical and biological stages is 
relatively frequent in AD. The mismatch may be influenced by a non-specific 
pathological process involved in AD. Individual profiles like aging and 
lifestyles may contribute to such a mismatch. Matched and mismatched cases 
converge toward similar clinical outcomes.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β (GSK3α/β) is a critical kinase for Tau 
hyperphosphorylation which contributes to neurodegeneration. Despite the 
termination of clinical trials for GSK3α/β inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) treatment, there is a pressing need for novel therapeutic strategies 
targeting GSK3α/β. Here, we identified the compound AS1842856 (AS), a specific 
forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) inhibitor, reduced intracellular GSK3α/β content 
in a FOXO1-independent manner. Specifically, AS directly bound to GSK3α/β, 
promoting its translocation to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and accelerating 
exocytosis, ultimately decreasing intracellular GSK3α/β content. Expectedly, AS 
treatment effectively suppressed Tau hyperphosphorylation in cells exposed to 
okadaic acid or expressing the TauP301S mutant. Furthermore, AS was visualized 
to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using an imaging mass microscope. 
Long-term treatment of AS enhanced cognitive function in P301S transgenic mice 
by mitigating Tau hyperphosphorylation through downregulation of GSK3α/β 
expression in the brain. Altogether, AS represents a novel small-molecule 
GSK3α/β inhibitor that facilitates GSK3α/β exocytosis, holding promise as a 
therapeutic agent for GSK3α/β hyperactivation-associated disorders.

BACKGROUND: Exercise interventions for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been 
extensively studied. However, there is no bibliometric study on exercise 
interventions for MCI. This study aimed to identify the collaborative networks, 
research hotspots, evolution trends, and future directions.
METHODS: Relevant documents were retrieved from the Web of Science Core 
Collection database. VOSviewer was used to analyze the co-authorship of the 
author, countries and institutions, and the keywords co-occurrence. CiteSpace 
was used to detect burst keywords' research trends.
RESULTS: A total of 569 articles were included and showed an overall increasing 
trend in annual publications. The most influential subject categories, authors, 
journals, country, and institutions were "geriatrics gerontology," "Doi, 
Takehiko and Shimada, Hiroyuki," "Journal of Alzheimer's Disease," USA, and 
"Veterans Health Administration," respectively. The research hotspots are 
"effectiveness," "neural mechanism" and "correlation" of exercise interventions, 
and the emerging trend is "intervention quality."
CONCLUSION: This area is in a rapid development phase, whereby research hotpots 
are focused and the research trend is clear. The highly productive authors and 
institutions have made outstanding contributions and the subject categories 
present an interdisciplinary trend. However, there is weak cooperation between 
countries and institutions, and a substantial research gap exists between 
developed and developing countries. Future research may highlight the 
intervention quality, emphasizing the combination with virtual reality 
technology.

Pharmacy, University of Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.

BACKGROUND: Both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and deliriogenic medications increase 
the risk of delirium in older adults. This study examined the association 
between delirium and the subsequent monthly use of anticholinergic, sedative, 
and opioid medications in the 1 year after delirium in older adults with AD.
METHODS: This comparative interrupted time series analysis involved adults (aged 
65 years and older) with a diagnosis of AD initiating on cholinesterase 
inhibitors (ChEIs) based on 2013-2017 Medicare data. Separate patient-level 
segmented regression models were used for each outcome to evaluate changes in 
the cumulative anticholinergic burden (CAB), sedative load, and opioid load 
after the delirium/index event using a 12-month baseline and follow-up period 
among patients who had a delirium event and those without delirium (control 
group). Propensity score-based stabilized weights were utilized to balance 
baseline factors in the delirium and control groups.
RESULTS: The study included 80,019 older adults with AD with incident ChEI use; 
17.11% had delirium. There was an immediate decline in monthly CAB after the 
delirium event (mean estimate -0.86, p-value: 0.01) compared to the control 
group. A similar decline was observed when examining the sedative load (-0.06, 
p-value: 0.002) after the delirium event. However, there was no decline in 
opioid load (-0.50, p-value: 0.18). In the long term, CAB (0.13; p-value: 
<0.0001), sedative load (0.01; p-value: <0.001), and opioid load (0.07; p-value: 
0.006) increased over the 1-year post-delirium period in the delirium group 
compared to those without delirium.
CONCLUSION: This study found the burden of deliriogenic medications over the 
1-year follow-up showed increasing trends in older adults with AD, even though 
there was some level shift in CAB and sedative load after the delirium event.

HPLC analysis, phytochemical screening, thin layer chromatography, polyphenols 
and flavonoid contents were conducted to determine the bioactive contents of the 
Algerian Seseli tortuosum plant. Antioxidant activity was tested using DPPH and 
ABTS scavenging assays, reducing power, phenanthroline and silver nanoparticle 
(SNP) assays. The anti-Alzheimer's activity of extracts was also performed 
in vitro and in silico. Phytochemical analysis highlighted the richness ofthe 
extracts in terms of coumarins, terpenoids and quercetin. The quantitative 
determination of total polyphenols and flavonoids showed that the highest 
amounts occurredinthe dichloromethane (DCME) and methanolic (MeOH) extracts. The 
antioxidant activities indicated a moderate potential. Compared with 
galantamine, DCME had a significantly greater anti-Alzheimer effect on 
BChE(CI50=9.14±1.74 μg/ml and 34.75±1.99 μg/ml respectively). An in silicostudy 
of anti-Alzheimer activity revealed a significant effect of 
quercetin(-30,13 KJ/mol). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the richness of 
the phytochemical components of seseli tortuosum,which are responsible for 
several biological properties, mainly their anti-Alzheimer potential.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) governs a wide spectrum of cellular fate 
processes, with a particular emphasis on anoikis, an integrin-dependent form of 
cell death. Currently, anoikis is defined as an intrinsic apoptosis. In contrast 
to traditional apoptosis and necroptosis, integrin correlates ECM signaling with 
intracellular signaling cascades, describing the full process of anoikis. 
However, anoikis is frequently overlooked in physiological and pathological 
processes as well as traditional in vitro research models. In this review, we 
summarized the role of anoikis in physiological and pathological processes, 
spanning embryonic development, organ development, tissue repair, inflammatory 
responses, cardiovascular diseases, tumor metastasis, and so on. Similarly, in 
the realm of stem cell research focused on the functional evolution of cells, 
anoikis offers a potential solution to various challenges, including in vitro 
cell culture models, stem cell therapy, cell transplantation, and engineering 
applications, which are largely based on the regulation of cell fate by anoikis. 
More importantly, the regulatory mechanisms of anoikis based on molecular 
processes and ECM signaling will provide new strategies for therapeutic 
interventions (drug therapy and cell-based therapy) in disease. In summary, this 
review provides a systematic elaboration of anoikis, thus shedding light on its 
future research.

Lyme disease (LD) can affect the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system as a 
multisystemic condition. The cause of the illness is the spirochete of the genus 
Borrelia. These pathogens can affect the skin, joints, heart, and nervous 
system. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is the term for the disease, which occurs 
when the nervous system gets involved. Regarding geographical distribution, LNB 
is more prevalent in Europe than in North America. The most significant change 
in pathogenesis is inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) and 
peripheral nervous system (PNS). Furthermore, clinically, it can represent a 
variety of neurological manifestations, such as meningitis, encephalitis, 
radiculopathies, and cranial neuritis. However, dementia-like syndrome is an 
infrequent manifestation of Lyme disease. Our review article aims to summarize 
the similarities and differences between dementia-like syndrome in LNB and that 
in primary neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to look for a correlation 
between the pathogenesis of the disease and the possibility of developing 
dementia-like syndrome. The world literature lacks sufficiently convincing data 
on the relationship between spirochete infection and primary dementia syndromes. 
However, cases of secondary dementia syndrome due to nervous system involvement 
as well as post-treatment have been described. A thorough examination, medical 
history, laboratory and imaging studies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, 
MRI, and fludeoxyglucose-18-positron emission tomography (FGD-PET) are required 
to differentiate between these syndromes.

Gene therapy as a disease-modifying therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), is a 
promising avenue. Promising results in the preclinical studies involving rodents 
and nonhuman primates utilizing gene therapy have led to multiple clinical 
trials evaluating various genes of interest for AD and PD. In AD, clinical 
trials are assessing gene therapy involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and other targets such as apolipoprotein E2 (APOE2) and human telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (hTERT). In PD, clinical trials are evaluating gene 
therapy delivering neurotrophic factors, such as glial cell line-derived 
neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Additionally, gene therapy delivering enzymes 
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 
are also being evaluated for PD. All these trials primarily utilized 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver the above transgene of interest. This 
review summarizes the current clinical trials involving gene therapy for AD and 
PD. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with the gene 
therapy approach in AD and PD and ongoing developments related to increasing the 
safety and efficacy of the gene therapy for long-term outcomes, which include 
evaluation of various serotypes and administration routes. This comprehensive 
review emphasizes translating preclinical findings into clinical trials, further 
directions, and the potential for this promising therapeutic approach to 
alleviate neurodegenerative disease.

Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital for effective treatment, as 
interventions are most successful in the disease's early stages. Combining 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with artificial intelligence (AI) offers 
significant potential for enhancing AD diagnosis. However, traditional AI models 
often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Explainable 
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an evolving field that aims to make AI 
decisions understandable to humans, providing transparency and insight into AI 
systems. This research introduces the Squeeze-and-Excitation Convolutional 
Neural Network with Random Forest (SECNN-RF) framework for early AD detection 
using MRI scans. The SECNN-RF integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks into 
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to focus on crucial features and uses 
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting. It then employs a Random Forest 
classifier to accurately categorize the extracted features. The SECNN-RF 
demonstrates high accuracy (99.89%) and offers an explainable analysis, 
enhancing the model's interpretability. Further exploration of the SECNN 
framework involved substituting the Random Forest classifier with other machine 
learning algorithms like Decision Tree, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and 
Gradient Boosting. While all these classifiers improved model performance, 
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by XGBoost, 
Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree which achieved 
lower accuracy.

Plasmalogens (Pls) are specialized phospholipids integral to brain health, whose 
decline due to aging and stress contributes to cognitive impairment and 
neuroinflammation. This study explores the potential of a novel Pls derivative, 
KIT-13 (1-O-octadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine), in 
mitigating neuroinflammation and enhancing cognition. When administered to mice, 
KIT-13 exhibited potent memory enhancement attributed to upregulated 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key player in cognitive processes. 
In vitro experiments with neuronal cells revealed KIT-13's ability to induce 
robust cellular signaling, surpassing natural plasmalogens. KIT-13 also promoted 
neurogenesis and inhibited apoptosis of neuronal-like cells, highlighting its 
potential in fostering neuronal growth and plasticity. Additionally, KIT-13 
treatments reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and attenuated glial 
activation in the brain. KIT-13's superior efficacy over natural Pls positions 
it as a promising therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease, characterized by cognitive decline and neuroinflammation. 
This study presents KIT-13 as an innovative approach for addressing cognitive 
impairment and neuroinflammatory pathologies.

Stimulating myelin restoration with BDNF: a promising therapeutic approach for 
Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder constituting 
the most common form of dementia (60%-70% of cases). Although AD presents 
majorly a neurodegenerative pathology, recent clinical evidence highlights 
myelin impairment as a key factor in disease pathogenesis. The lack of 
preventive or restorative treatment is emphasizing the need to develop novel 
therapeutic approaches targeting to the causes of the disease. Recent studies in 
animals and patients have highlighted the loss of myelination of the neuronal 
axons as an extremely aggravating factor in AD, in addition to the formation of 
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are to date the main 
pathological hallmarks of the disease. Myelin breakdown represents an early 
stage event in AD. However, it is still unclear whether myelin loss is 
attributed only to exogenous factors like inflammatory processes of the tissue 
or to impaired oligodendrogenesis as well. Neurotrophic factors are well 
established protective molecules under many pathological conditions of the 
neural tissue, contributing also to proper myelination. Due to their inability 
to be used as drugs, many research efforts are focused on substituting 
neurotrophic activity with small molecules. Our research team has recently 
developed novel micromolecular synthetic neurotrophin mimetics (MNTs), 
selectively acting on neurotrophin receptors, and thus offering a unique 
opportunity for innovative therapies against neurodegenerative diseases. These 
small sized, lipophilic molecules address the underlying biological effect of 
these diseases (neuroprotective action), but also they exert significant 
neurogenic actions inducing neuronal replacement of the disease areas. One of 
the significant neurotrophin molecules in the Central Nervous System is 
Brain-Derived-Neurotrophin-Factor (BDNF). BDNF is a neurotrophin that not only 
supports neuroprotection and adult neurogenesis, but also mediates 
pro-myelinating effects in the CNS. BDNF binds with high-affinity on the TrkB 
neurotrophin receptor and enhances myelination by increasing the density of 
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and playing an important role in CNS 
myelination. Conclusively, in the present review, we discuss the myelin 
pathophysiology in Alzheimer's Diseases, as well as the role of neurotrophins, 
and specifically BDNF, in myelin maintenance and restoration, revealing its 
valuable therapeutic potential against AD.

BACKGROUND: Delusions in neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
worsen patients' cognitive functions and activities of daily living (ADL), 
increasing caregiver burden and the risk of mortality. AD patients with 
delusions tend to experience a more rapid decline in cognition and have 
demonstrated poorer performance on various cognitive function tests. Considering 
the prognosis of delusion in AD patients, it tends to be more favorable with 
appropriate treatment. However, there is a lack of neuropsychological research, 
specifically examining the impact of delusions in AD, characterized by 
progressive deterioration of cognitive function. This study investigates the 
impact of delusions on cognitive function and ADL under conditions controlling 
for disease severity.
METHODS: We compared cognitive function and ADL in AD patients aged 65 years or 
older according to the presence of delusions. To assess longitudinal change, we 
analyzed data from patients monitored for an average of 15 to 16 months. We 
assessed cognitive function and ADL using the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening 
Battery-Second Edition (SNSB-II) and delusions using the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory (NPI). We used IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0 for all statistical 
analyses. The analysis was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. We 
investigated how delusions impact cognitive function and ADL, controlling for 
age, educational level, and disease severity.
RESULTS: The delusions group exhibited poorer immediate recall of verbal memory 
than the non-delusions group. In the follow-up evaluation, patients who 
developed delusions had lower baseline cognitive function than those who did 
not, and their language fluency declined over time. In addition, we found the 
presence of delusions associated with worse functional impairment in ADL as the 
disease progressed.
CONCLUSION: While controlling for the severity of AD, we found no significant 
negative impacts of delusions on most cognitive functions. Nevertheless, it is 
noteworthy that the immediate recall of verbal memory and the Controlled Oral 
Word Association Test (COWAT)_animal sensitively detected the negative impact of 
delusions. Furthermore, since delusions are associated with worsening ADL, we 
understand that delusion treatment is important for improving the quality of 
life for patients and caregivers.

An atom-economical sequential-flow synthesis of donepezil, a widely prescribed 
drug for Alzheimer's disease, was accomplished using inexpensive, commercially 
available precursors. This achievement was made possible by reconfiguring the 
synthetic route to include only heterogeneous catalytic addition and 
condensation reactions, with a particular emphasis on skeletal transformation 
and bond formation through hydrogenation processes. Notably, water was the sole 
byproduct in this synthesis. A crucial aspect of this work was the development 
of appropriate continuous-flow processes to achieve a one-flow synthesis. This 
was accomplished by implementing in-line treatments of the main reaction stream 
to eliminate inhibitory factors that could affect catalyst performance in the 
hydrogenation steps.

BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB; including stridor and sleep apnea 
syndromes) is frequent in multiple system atrophy (MSA), but the immediate 
effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is incompletely 
determined.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the acute effect and safety of CPAP therapy on 
SDB and sleep architecture, as well as the clinical characteristics of 
nonresponders to CPAP therapy.
METHODS: The measures of 63 consecutive patients with MSA who underwent a 
video-polysomnography during two consecutive nights (a first night in ambient 
air, a second night with or without CPAP, depending on the presence of SDB and 
availability of CPAP) in routine care were retrospectively collected. Linear 
mixed models assessed the two-night change in sleep and respiratory measures, 
comparing those with and without the CPAP therapy on the second night.
RESULTS: SDB was frequent and mainly associated with the cerebellar phenotype. 
The introduction of CPAP had immediate benefits, including the normalization of 
the apnea-hypopnea index and a resolution of stridor in more than two-thirds of 
the cases, decreased arousal index, and increased rapid eye movement sleep. CPAP 
therapy was well tolerated, and only two patients had emergent central apneas. 
Nonresponse to CPAP was generally associated with more severe motor disease.
CONCLUSIONS: CPAP seems a well-tolerated and effective therapy in patients with 
MSA and SDB in the short term. This treatment shows remarkable immediate 
benefits by objectively improving both respiratory disturbances and sleep 
architecture. © 2024 The Author(s). Movement Disorders published by Wiley

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis with pathological fractures is a significant public 
health issue, contributing to morbidity, disability, diminished quality of life, 
and increased mortality. Understanding mortality trends related to this 
condition is crucial for developing effective interventions to reduce mortality 
and improve healthcare outcomes. This study aimed to analyze trends and causes 
of death associated with osteoporosis and pathological fractures in the United 
States using a multi-cause approach.
METHODS: Annual death and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) data from 1999 
to 2020 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
mortality database. Death certificates listing ICD-10 M82 (osteoporosis with 
pathological fracture) as an underlying or related cause of death were analyzed. 
Epidemiological data were analyzed, and the ASMR data were calculated for each 
year, and trends were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage trend test.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2020, there were 40,441 deaths related to osteoporosis 
with pathological fractures in the United States, with a female-to-male ratio of 
5.6:1. Among these, 12,820 deaths (31.7%) listed osteoporosis with pathological 
fractures as the underlying cause of death (UCD), yielding a female-to-male ASMR 
ratio of approximately 5.0-7.7:1. When classified as a non-UCD, the ASMR ratio 
was approximately 4.8-6.2:1. At the same time, we found that the total number of 
deaths classified as UCD and multiple causes of death (MCD), but the trend ratio 
of the two groups in different years did not change statistically significant 
(P > 0.05), and the ASMR of both groups showed a downward trend. The UCD-to-MCD 
ratio increased between 1999 and 2007, then decreased from 2007 to 2020. As MCD, 
the number of female deaths was more than that of male, and both showed a 
decreasing trend, but there was no statistical significance in the change of 
trend ratio in different years (P > 0.05). Deaths were predominantly 
concentrated in individuals over 75 years of age, with those over 84 years being 
the most affected. The number of deaths in different age groups showed a 
decreasing trend, and the change of trend ratio in different years was 
statistically significant (P < 0.05). White individuals had the highest number 
of deaths. The leading causes of death were heart diseases, chronic lower 
respiratory diseases, and alzheimer's disease. In addition, the number of deaths 
of patients with prostate cancer and breast cancer showed a significant downward 
trend, and the change of trend ratio between the two groups in different years 
was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Although mortality from osteoporosis with pathological fractures is 
decreasing, anti-osteoporosis therapy remains essential for elderly patients. 
Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for potential complications, 
including malignant neoplasms, and ensure timely diagnosis and treatment to 
further reduce mortality in this population.

Stem cells have the potential to replace damaged or defective cells and assist 
in the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, including 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease. iPS cells derived from 
patient-specific somatic cells are not only ethically acceptable, but they also 
avoid complications relating to immune rejection. Currently, researchers are 
developing stem cell-based therapies for PD using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) 
cells. iPS cells can differentiate into cells from any of the three germ layers, 
including neural stem cells (NSCs). Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) 
is an emerging therapy for treating neurological disorders by restoring neuronal 
function. Nevertheless, there are still challenges associated with the quality 
and source of neural stem cells. This issue can be addressed by genetically 
edited iPS cells. In this study, shRNA was used to knock down the expression of 
mutant α-synuclein (SNCA) in iPS cells that were generated from SNCA A53T 
transgenic mice, and these iPS cells were differentiated to NSCs. After 
injecting these NSCs into SNCA A53T mice, the therapeutic effects of these cells 
were evaluated. We found that the transplantation of neural stem cells produced 
from SNCA A53T iPS cells with knocking down SNCA not only improved SNCA A53T 
mice coordination abilities, balance abilities, and locomotor activities but 
also significantly prolonged their lifespans. The results of this study suggest 
an innovative therapeutic approach that combines stem cell therapy and gene 
therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The cellular prion protein (PrPC) plays many roles in the developing and adult 
brain. In addition, PrPC binds to several amyloids in oligomeric and 
prefibrillar forms and may act as a putative receptor of abnormal misfolded 
protein species. The role of PrPC in tau seeding and spreading is not known. In 
the present study, we have inoculated well-characterized sarkosyl-insoluble 
fractions of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) into the brain of adult 
wild-type mice (Prnp+/+), Prnp0/0 (ZH3 strain) mice, and mice over-expressing 
the secreted form of PrPC lacking their GPI anchor (Tg44 strain). Phospho-tau 
(ptau) seeding and spreading involving neurons and oligodendrocytes were 
observed three and six months after inoculation. 3Rtau and 4Rtau deposits from 
the host tau, as revealed by inoculating Mapt0/0 mice and by using specific 
anti-mouse and anti-human tau antibodies suggest modulation of exon 10 splicing 
of the host mouse Mapt gene elicited by exogenous sAD-tau. However, no tau 
seeding and spreading differences were observed among Prnp genotypes. Our 
results show that PrPC does not affect tau seeding and spreading in vivo.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent 
in patients with genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We aimed to describe 
behavioral and neuropsychiatric phenotypes in genetic FTD, quantify their 
temporal association, and investigate their regional association with brain 
atrophy.
METHODS: We analyzed data of pathogenic variant carriers in the chromosome 9 
open reading frame 72 (c9orf72), progranulin (GRN), or microtubule-associated 
protein tau (MAPT) gene from the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative 
cohort study that enrolls both symptomatic pathogenic variant carriers and 
first-degree relatives of known carriers. Principal component analysis was 
performed to identify behavioral and neuropsychiatric clusters that were 
compared with respect to frequency and severity between groups. Associations 
between neuropsychiatric clusters and MRI-assessed atrophy were determined using 
voxel-based morphometry. We applied linear mixed effects and generalized linear 
mixed effects models to assess the longitudinal course of symptoms.
RESULTS: A total of 522 participants were included: 221 c9orf72 (138 
presymptomatic), 213 GRN (157 presymptomatic), and 88 MAPT (62 presymptomatic) 
pathogenic variant carriers. Principal component analysis revealed 5 phenotypic 
clusters (67.6% of variance), labeled diverse behavioral, affective, psychotic, 
euphoric/hypersexual, and tactile hallucinations phenotype. In participants 
presenting behavioral or neuropsychiatric symptoms, affective symptoms were most 
frequent across groups (83.6%-88.1%), followed by diverse behavioral symptoms 
(68.4%-77.9%). In c9orf72 and GRN pathogenic variant carriers, psychotic 
symptoms (32.0% and 19.4%, respectively) were more frequent than 
euphoric/hypersexual symptoms (28.7% and 14.2%, respectively), which was the 
other way around in MAPT pathogenic variant carriers (28.6% and 23.8%). Although 
diverse behavioral symptoms were associated with gray and white matter 
frontotemporal atrophy, only a small atrophy cluster in the right thalamus was 
associated with psychotic symptoms. Euphoric/hypersexual symptoms were 
associated with atrophy in mesial temporal lobes, basal forebrain structures, 
and the striatum (p < 0.05). Estimated time to symptom onset, genetic group, 
education, and sex influenced behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms (p < 
0.05). Particularly, in c9orf72 pathogenic variant carriers, psychotic symptoms 
may be starting decades before recognition of onset of illness.
DISCUSSION: We identified multiple clusters of behavioral and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms in participants with genetic FTD that relate to distinct cerebral 
atrophy patterns. Their severity depends on time, affected gene, sex, and 
education. These clinical-genetic associations can guide diagnostic evaluations 
and the design of clinical trials for new disease-modifying and preventive 
treatments.

Alzheimer Disease: Treatment of Cognitive and Functional Symptoms.

Alzheimer disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. 
Alzheimer disease affects cognitive function, leading to memory loss and 
impairment in activities of daily living. Approximately 6.9 million people in 
the United States 65 years and older live with Alzheimer disease, a number 
expected to double by 2060. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer disease, 
treatments are available to manage symptoms. Tools such as the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., criteria aid in identifying 
major neurocognitive disorders. The evaluation involves a comprehensive medical 
history, cognitive examinations, and collateral information. Nonpharmacologic 
interventions focus on psychosocial approaches, with music, sensory stimulation, 
and validation therapies showing some evidence of reducing responsive behaviors. 
Pharmacologic management, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, 
galantamine, rivastigmine) and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist 
memantine, targets symptom relief and disease progression. Vitamin E does not 
improve cognition but may mitigate functional decline. Brexpiprazole has been 
approved in the United States for treating agitation associated with Alzheimer 
disease. Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody treatments are approved for mild 
cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer disease, but they are controversial and 
safety concerns exist. Ineffective therapies include ginkgo biloba, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, omega-3 fatty acids, and statins.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected not only individual lives but 
also the world and global systems, both natural and human-made. Besides millions 
of deaths and environmental challenges, the rapid spread of the infection and 
its very high socioeconomic impact have affected healthcare, economic status and 
wealth, and mental health across the globe. To better appreciate the pandemic's 
influence, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches are needed. In 
this chapter, world-leading scientists from different backgrounds share 
collectively their views about the pandemic's footprint and discuss challenges 
that face the international community.

BACKGROUND: Commercial genome-wide genotyping arrays have historically neglected 
coverage of genetic variation across populations.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to create a multi-ancestry genome-wide array that would 
include a wide range of neuro-specific genetic content to facilitate genetic 
research in neurological disorders across multiple ancestral groups, fostering 
diversity and inclusivity in research studies.
METHODS: We developed the Illumina NeuroBooster Array (NBA), a custom 
high-throughput and cost-effective platform on a backbone of 1,914,934 variants 
from the Infinium Global Diversity Array and added custom content comprising 
95,273 variants associated with more than 70 neurological conditions or traits, 
and we further tested its performance on more than 2000 patient samples. This 
novel platform includes approximately 10,000 tagging variants to facilitate 
imputation and analyses of neurodegenerative disease-related genome-wide 
association study loci across diverse populations.
RESULTS: In this article, we describe NBA's potential as an efficient means for 
researchers to assess known and novel disease genetic associations in a 
multi-ancestry framework. The NBA can identify rare genetic variants and 
accurately impute more than 15 million common variants across populations. Apart 
from enabling sample prioritization for further whole-genome sequencing studies, 
we envisage that NBA will play a pivotal role in recruitment for interventional 
studies in the precision medicine space.
CONCLUSIONS: From a broader perspective, the NBA serves as a promising means to 
foster collaborative research endeavors in the field of neurological disorders 
worldwide. Ultimately, this carefully designed tool is poised to make a 
substantial contribution to uncovering the genetic etiology underlying these 
debilitating conditions. © 2024 The Author(s). Movement Disorders published by

Worldwide, around 50 million people live with dementia, and this number is 
projected to triple by 2050. It has been estimated that 20% of all dementia 
cases have a predominant cerebrovascular pathology, while perhaps another 20% of 
vascular diseases contribute to a mixed dementia picture. Therefore, the 
vascular contribution to dementia affects 20 million people currently and will 
increase markedly in the next few decades, particularly in lower- and 
middle-income countries.In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of vascular 
cognitive impairment (VCI) and review management. VCI refers to the spectrum of 
cerebrovascular pathologies that contribute to any degree of cognitive 
impairment, ranging from subjective cognitive decline, to mild cognitive 
impairment, to dementia. While acute cognitive decline occurring soon after a 
stroke is the most recognized form of VCI, chronic cerebrovascular disease, in 
particular cerebral small-vessel disease, can cause insidious cognitive decline 
in the absence of stroke. Moreover, cerebrovascular disease not only commonly 
co-occurs with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases the probability that AD 
pathology will result in clinical dementia, but may also contribute 
etiologically to the development of AD pathologies.Despite its enormous health 
and economic impact, VCI has been a neglected research area, with few adequately 
powered trials of therapies, resulting in few proven treatments. Current 
management of VCI emphasizes prevention and treatment of stroke and vascular 
risk factors, with most evidence for intensive hypertension control. Reperfusion 
therapies in acute stroke may attenuate the risk of VCI. Associated behavioral 
symptoms such as apathy and poststroke emotionalism are common. We also 
highlight novel treatment strategies that will hopefully lead to new disease 
course-modifying therapies. Finally, we highlight the importance of including 
cognitive endpoints in large cardiovascular prevention trials and the need for 
an increased research focus and funding for this important area.

INTRODUCTION: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and inflammatory biomarkers 
are crucial for investigating preclinical neurocognitive disorders. Current 
investigations focus on a few inflammatory markers. The study aims to 
investigate the associations between inflammatory biomarkers and MRI measures 
and to examine sex differences among the associations in the Framingham Heart 
Study.
METHODS: Dementia and stroke-free participants underwent OLINK Proteomics 
profiling and MRI measurements within 5 years. Pairwise cross-sectional analysis 
assessed 68 biomarkers with 13 brain MRI volumes, adjusting for covariates and 
familial correlations.
RESULTS: Elevated CDCP1, IL6, OPG, and 4E.BP1 were related to smaller total 
cerebral brain volume (TCBV), whereas higher HGF, IL8, and MMP10 were associated 
with smaller TCBV, total and frontal white matter volumes. Higher SCF and TWEAK 
were associated with larger TCBV. In sex-stratified analyses, associations were 
observed exclusively among males.
DISCUSSION: We report several associations between inflammatory biomarkers and 
brain volumes, highlighting different associations within sex subgroups.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher CDCP1, IL6, OPG, and 4E.BP1 levels were associated with 
smaller TCBV. Higher levels of HGF, IL8 and MMP10 were associated with smaller 
TCBV, CWV and FWV. Higher levels of SCF and TWEAK, were associated with larger 
TCBV. Significance diminished in models adjusting for CVD risk factors. 
Associations were observed exclusively in males.

LD14b is an amyloid-β (Aβ) 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 
(Aβ-17β-HSD10) protein-protein interaction modulator that shows promising in 
vitro and ex vivo activity to rescue Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, 
Aβ-induced toxicity, and Aβ-mediated inhibition of estradiol synthesis.The 
current study investigated in vitro human S9 fractions metabolic stability, 
apparent permeability, human and mouse plasma protein binding, in vivo 
pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution in Balb/cJ mice. A fast (8-min), 
sensitive, reliable, and reproducible LC-MS/MS method was developed and 
validated over the dynamic range of 1-1000 ng/mL for the quantification of LD14b 
in different biological matrices (plasma, liver, kidney, brain, lungs, 
heart).LD14b was metabolically stable in human liver S9 fractions with 70% 
remaining after 90 minutes of incubation, showed intermediate apparent 
permeability of 3.55 × 10-06 cm/s and 6.16 × 10-06 cm/s for 
apical-to-basolateral (A-to-B) and basolateral-to-apical (B-to-A), respectively 
across the Caco-2 monolayer, and was medium/highly bound to human plasma 
proteins (84.1%), mouse plasma proteins (85.7%), and mouse brain homogenate 
(95.4%).LD14b showed an in vivo predicted % absorption of 52% in Balb/cJ mice 
and was well-distributed to the peripheral tissues (liver, kidney, lungs, and 
heart) including the brain.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is a potentially modifiable factor in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD); however, understanding of its composition and function regarding 
AD pathology is limited.
METHODS: Shallow-shotgun metagenomic data was used to analyze fecal microbiome 
from participants enrolled in the Wisconsin Microbiome in Alzheimer's Risk 
Study, leveraging clinical data and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. 
Differential abundance and ordinary least squares regression analyses were 
performed to find differentially abundant gut microbiome features and their 
associations with CSF biomarkers of AD and related pathologies.
RESULTS: Gut microbiome composition and function differed between people with AD 
and cognitively unimpaired individuals. The compositional difference was 
replicated in an independent cohort. Differentially abundant gut microbiome 
features were associated with CSF biomarkers of AD and related pathologies.
DISCUSSION: These findings enhance our understanding of alterations in gut 
microbial composition and function in AD, and suggest that gut microbes and 
their pathways are linked to AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are strongly linked to 
cardiovascular risk factors and other health conditions such as Alzheimer's 
disease. However, there is a dearth of research on this topic in low-income 
countries and underserved populations, especially in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC) where the population is aging rapidly with increasing cardiovascular 
risk factors and dementia-related diseases. This study evaluates health factors 
associated with WMH in the elderly Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), specifically 
Congolese adults.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 77 people from the DRC, participants 
underwent neuroimaging to analyze WMH volume and completed clinical evaluation, 
laboratory-based blood exams, self-reported questionnaires, and interviews. A 
simple linear regression model was conducted to test the association between WMH 
and potential predictors (neurological status, age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, 
tobacco abuse, stroke, high cholesterol, cardiovascular medication, and alcohol 
abuse). Stepwise selection and backward elimination analyses were performed to 
obtain the final model. Finally, a multiple linear regression model was 
conducted to assess the association between WMH and variables retained in the 
final model (neurological status, sex, and age).
RESULTS: Of the 77 individuals, 47 (61%) had dementia, 40 (52.6%) were males, 
and the mean age was 73 years (± 8.0 years standard deviation). In simple linear 
regression models, WMH was significantly associated with dementia (expβ1=1.75, 
95% CI=1.14 - 2.71, p-value=0.01) though it had a weak association with age 
(expβ1=1.03, 95% CI=1.00 - 1.05, p-value=0.05) and sex (male) (expβ1=0.66, 95% 
CI=0.43 - 1.01, p-value=0.05). In multiple linear regression models, WMH was 
statistically significantly associated with dementia (expβ1=1.97, 95% CI=1.31 - 
2.95, p-value =0.001), male sex (expβ2=0.54, 95% CI=0.36 - 0.80, p-value=0.003), 
and age (expβ3=1.03, 95% CI=1.00 - 1.06, p-value=0.03). However, WMH was not 
significantly associated with common cardiovascular risk factors, such as high 
blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco use, obesity, and high cholesterol levels.
CONCLUSION: WMH is significantly associated with neurological status, sex, and 
age in the Congolese population. Understanding these predictors may improve our 
ability to diagnose, assess, and develop preventative treatments for white 
matter disease in SSA/DRC populations, where neuroimaging is difficult to 
obtain.

Lysosomal transmembrane protein 5: Impact on immune cell function and 
implications for immune-related deficiencies.

Lysosomal transmembrane protein 5 (LAPTM5) is a lysosomal-associated protein 
that interacts with surface receptors on various immune cells, including B 
cells, T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Dysregulated expression of 
LAPTM5 is implicated in the development of multiple immune system-related 
diseases. In the context of tumors, elevated LAPTM5 levels in immune cells are 
associated with decreased cell membrane levels of T cell receptors (TCR) or B 
cell receptors (BCR), leading to impaired antigen presentation and immune 
escape, thereby promoting tumor progression. Besides, LAPTM5 is critical for 
inducing non-apoptotic cell death in tumor parenchymal cells since its 
downregulation leads to inhibition of the cell death pathway in the tumor 
parenchyma and subsequent enhanced tumorigenesis. LAPTM5 also affects the cell 
cycle as the elevated LAPTM5 expression in solid tumors causes its inability to 
block the G0/G1 stage. In non-solid tumors, abnormal LAPTM5 expression disrupts 
blood cell development and causes irregular proliferation. Furthermore, in the 
nervous system, aberrant LAPTM5 expression in microglia is correlated with 
Alzheimer's disease severity. In this context, further preclinical research is 
essential to validate LAPTM5 as a potential target for diagnosis, therapy, and 
prognosis in immune-related disorders and tumors. This review summarized the 
current insights into LAPTM5's role in tumors and immune-related deficits, 
highlighting its potential as a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target.

High fat diet (HFD) is a prime factor, which contributes to the present epidemic 
of metabolic syndrome. Prolonged intake of HFD induces oxidative stress (OS) 
that in turn causes neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, insulin resistance, 
amyloid burden, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment hence leading to 
Alzheimer's disease neuropathy. Melatonin (secreted by the Pineal gland) has the 
potential to nullify the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and have 
been shown to ameliorate various complications induced by HFD in rodent models. 
This study aimed to assess the neurotherapeutic effects of melatonin on 
HFD-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration mediated by OS in pregnant 
female mice and their offspring. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and 
antioxidant enzyme assays were used for quantification of samples from the 
hippocampal region of the brain of pregnant albino mice and their offspring. 
Short- and long-term memory was assessed by Y-maze and Morris Water Maze tests. 
HFD significantly induced OS leading to AD like neuropathology in the pregnant 
mice and their offspring while melatonin administration simultaneously with the 
HFD significantly prevented this neuropathy. This study reports that melatonin 
exerts these effects through the stimulation of SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway that in 
turn reduces the HFD-induced OS and its downstream signaling. In conclusion 
melatonin prevents HFD-induced multiple complications that ultimately leads to 
the memory dysfunction in pregnant female mice and their successive generation 
via activation of SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Vascular endothelial cells, serving as a barrier between blood and the arterial 
wall, play a crucial role in the early stages of the development of 
atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Mitochondria, known as the powerhouses of the cell, are not only involved in 
energy production but also regulate key biological processes in vascular 
endothelial cells, including redox signaling, cellular aging, calcium 
homeostasis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. The 
mitochondrial quality control (MQC) system is essential for maintaining 
mitochondrial homeostasis. Current research indicates that mitochondrial 
dysfunction is a significant driver of endothelial injury and CVDs. This article 
provides a comprehensive overview of the causes of endothelial injury in CVDs, 
ischemic stroke in cerebrovascular diseases, and AD, elucidating the roles and 
mechanisms of mitochondria in these conditions, and aims to develop more 
effective therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the article offers treatment 
strategies for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, including the use of 
clinical drugs, antioxidants, stem cell therapy, and specific polyphenols, 
providing new insights and methods for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of 
related vascular injuries to improve patient prognosis and quality of life. 
Future research should delve deeper into the molecular and mechanistic links 
between mitochondrial abnormalities and endothelial injury, and explore how to 
regulate mitochondrial function to prevent and treat CVDs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that affects 
elderly individuals, characterized by senile plaques formed by extracellular 
amyloid beta (Aβ). Autophagy dysfunction is a manifestation of protein 
homeostasis imbalance in patients with AD, but its relationship with Aβ remains 
unclear. Here, we showed that in Aβ transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans, Aβ 
activated the TOR pathway and reduced the nuclear entry of HLH-30, leading to 
autophagy dysfunction characterized by autophagosome accumulation. Then, 
utilizing RNA-seq, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms by which HLH-30 
modulates autophagy in C. elegans. We found that HLH-30 elevated the transcript 
levels of v-ATPase and cathepsin, thus enhancing lysosomal activity. This led to 
an increase in autophagic flux, facilitating more pronounced degradation of Aβ. 
Moreover, HLH-30 reduced the level of ROS induction by Aβ and enhanced the 
antioxidant stress capacity of the worms through the gsto-1 gene. Additionally, 
we identified two HLH-30/TFEB activators, saikosaponin B2 and hypericin, that 
improved autophagic flux, thereby enhancing protein homeostasis in C. elegans. 
Overall, our findings suggested that HLH-30/TFEB plays a key role in modulating 
autophagy and can be considered a promising drug target for AD treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of disability and one of the top 
causes of mortality globally. AD remains a major public health challenge due to 
its prevalence, impact on patients and caregivers, and the current lack of a 
cure. In recent years, polyphenols have garnered attention for their potential 
therapeutic effects on AD. The objective of the study was to establish network 
pharmacology between selected polyphenols of plant origin and AD. Insilico tools 
such as SwissADME, ProTox3.0, pkCSM, Swiss Target Prediction, DisGeNET, 
InterActiVenn, DAVID database, STRING database, Cytoscape/CytoHubba were 
employed to establish the multi-target potential of the polyphenolic compounds. 
The present study revealed that out of 17 polyphenols, 10 ligands were found to 
possess a drug-likeness nature along with desirable pharmacokinetic parameters 
and a lesser toxicity profile. Also, the results highlighted the possible 
interactions between the polyphenols and the disease targets involved in AD. 
Further, this study has shed light on the mTOR pathway and its impact on AD 
through the autophagic mechanism. Overall, this study indicated that polyphenols 
could be a better therapeutic option for treating AD. Hence, the consumption of 
polyphenolic cocktails as a part of the diet could produce more effective 
outcomes against the disease. Additional studies are warranted in the future to 
explore additional pathways and genes to provide a comprehensive understanding 
regarding the usage of the shortlisted polyphenols and their derivatives for the 
prevention and treatment of AD.

Abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is a principal pathological 
hallmark in the onset of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), which can be induced by an excess of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS). As an antioxidant, hydrogen gas (H2) has the potential to mitigate AD by 
scavenging highly harmful ROS such as •OH. However, conventional administration 
methods of H2 face significant challenges in controlling H2 release on demand 
and fail to achieve effective accumulation at lesion sites. Herein, we report 
artificial nanoreactors that mimic natural photosynthesis to realize 
near-infrared (NIR) light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution in situ. The 
nanoreactors are constructed by biocompatible crosslinked vesicles (CVs) 
encapsulating ascorbic acid and two photosensitizers, chlorophyll a (Chla) and 
indoline dye (Ind). In addition, platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) serve as 
photocatalysts and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) act as light-harvesting 
antennas in the nanoreacting system, and both attach to the surface of CVs. 
Under NIR irradiation, the nanoreactors release H2 in situ to scavenge local 
excess ROS and attenuate tau hyperphosphorylation in the AD mice model. Such 
NIR-triggered nanoreactors provide a proof-of-concept design for the great 
potential of hydrogen therapy against AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that progressively impairs 
cognitive function and results in memory loss. Despite substantial research 
efforts, little is known about the specific processes driving AD, and there are 
few proven therapies. Because of their physiological and genetic resemblance to 
humans, zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become an important model organism for 
furthering research on AD. This abstract discusses the difficulties faced, looks 
at the insights currently garnered from zebrafish models, and suggests future 
research options. AD knowledge has greatly benefited from the use of zebrafish 
models. Transgenic zebrafish that express human AD-associated genes, such as tau 
and amyloid precursor protein (APP), display tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) 
and amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, two of the disease's main clinical 
characteristics. These models have clarified the roles of oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and calcium homeostasis in the course of AD and allowed for the 
purpose of high-throughput screening of potential therapeutic 
agents. Understanding the growth and deterioration of neurons has been greatly 
aided by real-time zebrafish imaging. Fully using zebrafish models in AD 
research requires addressing a number of issues. The dissimilarities in 
zebrafish anatomy and physiology from humans, the difficulty of developing 
models that replicate progressive and late-onset AD (LOAD), and the requirement 
for standardized procedures to evaluate alterations in zebrafish cognition and 
behavior are a few issues. Furthermore, variations in the genetic makeup of 
zebrafish strains might affect the results of experiments. Future directions 
include developing standardized behavioral assays and cognitive tests, working 
together to create extensive databases of zebrafish genetic and phenotypic data, 
and using genetic engineering techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 to create more complex 
zebrafish models. Combining zebrafish models with other model species helps 
expedite the conversion of research results into therapeutic applications and 
offers a more thorough knowledge of AD. To sum up, zebrafish models have made a 
substantial contribution to Alzheimer's research by offering insightful 
information on the causes of the illness and possible therapies. By tackling 
present issues and formulating a planned future path, we can improve the use of 
zebrafish to decipher the mysteries of Alzheimer's and help create successful 
treatments.

An increasing number of medications have been explored to treat the progressive 
and irreversible Alzheimer's disease (AD) that stands as the predominant form of 
dementia among neurodegenerative ailments. However, assertions about toxic side 
effects of these drugs are a significant hurdle to overcome, calling for 
drug-free nanotherapeutics. Herein, a new therapeutic strategy devoid of 
conventional drugs or other cytotoxic species was developed. The constructed 
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) nanospinners can accrete 
neurotoxic β-amyloid 42 oligomers (oAβ42) into aggregated magnetic plaques 
(mpAβ) by mechanical rotating force via remote interaction between nanoparticles 
and the applied magnetic field. While the cellular uptake of mpAβ attained from 
the magnetic stirring treatment by neuronal cells is severely limited, the 
facile phagocytic uptake of mpAβ by microglial cells leads to the polarization 
of the brain macrophages to M2 phenotype and thus the increased 
anti-inflammatory responses to the treatment. The SPION stirring treatment 
protects the AD mice from memory deterioration and maintain cognitive ability as 
evidenced from both nesting and Barnes maze tests. The examination of the oAβ42 
injected brain tissues with the stirring treatment showed significant 
amelioration of functional impairment of neurons, microglia, astrocytes and 
oligodendrocytes alongside no obvious tissue damage caused by stirring meanwhile 
complete degradation of SPION was observed at day 7 after the treatment. The in 
vitro and animal data of this work strongly corroborate that this new modality 
of undruggable stirring treatment with SPIONs provides a new feasible strategy 
for developing novel AD treatments.

OBJECTIVE: Findings concerning the effects of hormone therapy (HT) on cognition 
and dementia are mixed, with some trials suggesting increased harm at older 
ages. Personality, like cognition, changes with dementia, but no clinical trials 
to date have examined the effects of HT on personality traits. This study aimed 
to determine the effects of HT on personality traits in older men and women.
METHOD: Secondary data analysis was performed from randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled cross-over studies of menopausal HT in women and testosterone 
therapy (TT) in men. Participants were community-dwelling cognitively normal 
adults (mean age = 75.2 years), including 29 men and 22 women. Three months of 
hormone intervention (for women, 0.625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogen with or 
without 2.5 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate; for men, 200 mg intramuscular 
testosterone enanthate every 2 weeks) were crossed over with 3 months of 
identical placebo with a 3-month washout between intervention phases. The main 
outcome measure was neuroticism and conscientiousness personality domains and 
facets assessed with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) after the 
active and placebo intervention phases.
RESULTS: In linear mixed-effect models, HT in women decreased conscientiousness 
(p < 0.01) and the conscientiousness facet of achievement striving (p < 0.01), 
and increased vulnerability, a facet of neuroticism (p < 0.05). Testosterone in 
men decreased conscientiousness (p < 0.05) and the conscientiousness facet of 
dutifulness (p < 0.05), and increased vulnerability (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In a preliminary study of healthy older adults, HT and TT 
formulations produced adverse changes in vulnerability and conscientiousness 
facets that parallel personality changes in dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) 
exhibit varying survival outcomes due to the unique challenges in managing AD 
patients. Stratifying patient mortality risk and understanding the criticality 
of nursing care are important to improve the clinical outcomes of AD patients. 
This study aimed to leverage machine learning (ML) and electronic health records 
(EHRs) only consisting of demographics, disease history, and routine lab tests, 
with a focus on nursing care, to facilitate the optimization of nursing 
practices for AD patients. We utilized Medical Information Mart for Intensive 
Care III, an open-source EHR dataset, and AD patients were identified based on 
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. From a 
cohort of 453 patients, a total of 60 features, encompassing demographics, 
laboratory tests, disease history, and number of nursing events, were extracted. 
ML models, including XGBoost, random forest, logistic regression, and 
multi-layer perceptron, were trained to predict the 30-day mortality risk. In 
addition, the influence of nursing care was analyzed in terms of feature 
importance using values calculated from both the inherent XGBoost module and the 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) library. XGBoost emerged as the lead model 
with a high accuracy of 0.730, area under the curve (AUC) of 0.750, sensitivity 
of 0.688, and specificity of 0.740. Feature importance analyses using inherent 
XGBoost module or SHAP both indicated the number of nursing care within 14 days 
post-admission as an important denominator for 30-day mortality risk. When 
nursing care events were excluded as a feature, stratifying patient mortality 
risk was also possible but the model's AUC of receiver operating characteristic 
curve was reduced to 0.68. Nursing care plays a pivotal role in the survival 
outcomes of AD patients in ICUs. ML models can be effectively employed to 
predict mortality risks and underscore the importance of specific features, 
including nursing care, in patient outcomes. Early identification of high-risk 
AD patients can aid in prioritizing intensive nursing care, potentially 
improving survival rates.
