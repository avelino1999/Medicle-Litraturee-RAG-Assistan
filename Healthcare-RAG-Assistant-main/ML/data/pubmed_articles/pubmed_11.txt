BACKGROUND: Identifying early neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) is important for improving treatment efficacy. Among quantitative MRI 
measures, transverse relaxation time (T2) has been shown to reflect tissue 
microstructure relevant in aging and neurodegeneration; however, findings 
regarding T2 changes in both normal aging and AD have been inconsistent. The 
association between T2 and amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, a hallmark of AD 
pathology, is also unclear, particularly in cognitively normal individuals who 
may be in preclinical stages of the disease.
PURPOSE: To investigate longitudinal hippocampal T2 changes in a cognitively 
normal cohort of older adults and their association with global Aβ accumulation.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective, longitudinal.
SUBJECTS: 56 cognitively normal adults between 55 and 90 years of age (17 males 
and 39 females).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 Tesla; multi-echo spin echo sequence for T2 mapping; 
18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography for Aβ measurement.
ASSESSMENT: Bilateral hippocampal T2 and volume were extracted to relate to Aβ 
PET measurements. To understand variations in AD risk, participants were 
separated into Aβ-high and Aβ-low subgroups using a predetermined threshold.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Linear mixed-effect models and general linear models were 
used. A p-value < 0.025 was considered significant to account for bilateral 
comparisons.
RESULTS: Older age was associated with increased T2 in the bilateral hippocampus 
(left: β = 0.30, right: β = 0.25) and smaller hippocampal volume on the left 
(β = -0.12). In the Aβ-low subgroup, both longitudinal T2 increase rates 
(β = 0.65) in the left hippocampus and bilateral cross-sectional T2 (left: 
β = 0.64, right: β = 0.46) were positively correlated with Aβ PET, independent 
of hippocampal volume.
DATA CONCLUSION: This study provided in vivo evidence linking hippocampal T2 to 
Aβ accumulation in cognitively normal aging individuals, suggesting that 
quantitative T2 may be sensitive to microstructural changes accompanying early 
Aβ pathology, such as neuroinflammation, demyelination, and reduced tissue 
integrity.
EVIDENCE LEVEL: 3.
TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential by-products of cellular metabolism 
and serve as key mediators in cell signaling and homeostasis. Excessive ROS 
production is associated with cellular damage and various diseases. Therefore, 
targeted ROS scavenging may enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize side 
effects. With significant progress in nanotechnology, various nanomaterials with 
targeted ROS-scavenging properties have been developed to modulate ROS levels in 
biological microenvironments. In this review, the mechanisms underlying ROS 
generation and elimination in humans and in ROS-related diseases are first 
outlined. The latest advancements in ROS-scavenging nanomaterials, particularly 
their mechanisms and composition-based classifications, are then focused on. 
Strategies for improving the targeting ability of ROS-scavenging nanomaterials 
and their application in the therapeutics of ROS-induced diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, acute kidney injury, diabetic wounds, 
and cancer are highlighted. Finally, the challenges faced by ROS-targeted 
nanotherapeutics are discussed, and possible alternatives to accelerate their 
clinical translation are proposed.

The development of novel treatments that restore brain function and improve 
patient outcomes for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is necessary, given the 
complications and lack of improvement in recently approved amyloid beta 
(Aβ)-targeting drugs. Cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been found 
to improve cognitive function through reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, 
and apoptosis, restoring neuronal and blood-brain barrier function, and 
inhibiting Aβ and phosphorylated tau build-up in the brain. Given the recent 
emergence of EVs into clinical trials, it is essential to provide the field with 
an update on proposed mechanisms of action, gaps in knowledge for further study, 
and recommendations for producing EVs with high therapeutic efficacy to ensure 
success in subsequent clinical trials. This systematic review summarizes 
original research to date that reports effects of mammalian cell-derived EVs for 
the treatment of AD. Evidence of therapeutic benefits and reported mechanisms of 
action are discussed. Further, methods for engineering EVs to increase their 
therapeutic efficacy and produce high-quality EVs relevant to the AD field are 
outlined. The quality of evidence is discussed in terms of reporting guidelines 
from the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV). The 
review further discusses current preclinical AD models and provides direction to 
improve the quality of AD models for testing novel therapeutics.

Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, a leading cause of global disability and 
mortality, encompass a wide range of brain disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and so on. These diseases are characterized by 
dynamic cellular heterogeneity and disrupted intercellular crosstalk, yet their 
molecular drivers remain incompletely resolved. Single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) dissects transcriptional diversity at cellular resolution, while 
spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps niche-specific interactions within tissue 
architecture-complementary approaches that have revealed disease-associated 
subpopulations, neural-glial communication, and microenvironmental remodeling. 
However, standalone omics layers inadequately capture the genetic, epigenetic, 
and functional cascades underlying CNS pathologies. Here, we highlight the 
transformative potential of integrating scRNA-seq and ST with multiomic 
profiling to delineate spatially orchestrated molecular networks. Such multiomic 
convergence enables systematic deconstruction of molecular mechanisms and 
intercellular communication across disease progression. By correlating these 
signatures with clinical phenotypes, this strategy accelerates biomarker 
discovery, patient stratification, and therapeutic target identification. We 
further discuss challenges in data harmonization, subcellular spatial 
resolution, and computational scalability that must be addressed to realize 
personalized CNS medicine. This synthesis advocates for interdisciplinary 
frameworks to translate multiomic insights into mechanistically grounded 
diagnostics and therapies, ultimately bridging the gap between molecular 
discovery and precision clinical intervention.

BACKGROUND: Treatment for complex multifactorial neurological disorders may 
benefit more from multifunctional chemicals. Dysregulation of monoaminergic 
pathways and neuroinflammation are typical confluence points in a range of 
neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses. Polypharmacological 
medications that affect neuroinflammatory and monoaminergic pathways were 
investigated as potential targets for these diseases. The aim of this study was 
to investigate the in vitro and in silico multi-target neuroprotective activity 
of Khaya grandifololia.
METHODS: Decoction and hydro-ethanolic extracts were prepared and screened for 
their ability to inhibit enzymes related to inflammation (15-lipoxygenase, LOX), 
neurodegeneration (monoamine oxidase, MAO), and protein glycation and 
fibrillation using enzymological fluorimetric assays and docking simulations.
RESULTS: All extracts were able to strongly inhibit the activity of MAO as well 
as the glycation and fibrillation activities. Also, these extracts moderately 
inhibited 15-LOX activity.
CONCLUSION: These results extend the knowledge on the potential use of Khaya 
grandifololia to combat multifactorial disorders, giving new approaches into 
therapeutic avenues for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease.

Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
fibromyalgia (FM), and chronic infection, are risk factors for neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). This 
review synthesizes evidence from longitudinal cohort studies and clinical 
trials, highlighting the contrasting evidence to explain the complex association 
between systemic inflammation and neurodegeneration. These important mechanisms 
are disruption of the blood-brain barrier, microglial activation, 
cytokine-related neurotoxicity (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha), lysosomal maladaptation, 
and metabolic imbalance (e.g., insulin resistance, hyperglycemia). 
Disease-specific correlations present study outcomes that are paradoxical, 
including that RA has genetic protection against PD but an increased risk of AD, 
whereas obesity and T2D associations are the same across studies, persistent 
associations of these terms with worsened cognitive decline. The risk of 
dementia is worsened by autoimmune diseases, such as SLE and FM, involving 
neuroinflammation caused by autoantibodies and central sensitization in the 
latter, respectively. The new markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) (neuroinflammation) and neurofilament light (NfL) (axonal injury), have 
prospects in early detection, but there is a need for validation in future 
studies. Therapeutic approaches emphasize the need for immunomodulation (e.g., 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs {DMARDs} in RA), glycemic control in T2DM, 
and lifestyle interventions, with a lack of targeting the non-amyloid pathways. 
New studies should emphasize longitudinal studies, multiome-based methods, and 
clinical trials in an attempt to create precision treatment. Considering the 
inflammatory risk stratification in the prevention of neurodegeneration, this 
review sheds light on the possibility of early preventative action that may 
offset the progressive cognitive decline in especially vulnerable groups.

An 85-year-old female patient with multiple comorbidities, including Parkinson's 
disease, hyperthyroidism, congestive heart failure, and Alzheimer's, presented 
with dyspnea, weakness, and cough. She was found to have new-onset atrial 
fibrillation and a left frontal lobe infarct. Initially treated with 
levofloxacin and then azithromycin, she later developed right lung infiltrates, 
and ceftriaxone 2g IV daily was initiated. Within 48 hours, liver enzymes 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) rose markedly 
(from 11/26 to 452/415 U/L). We promptly discontinued ceftriaxone in response 
and considered alternative antibiotics. The multidisciplinary team opted for 
supportive management with daily liver function monitoring, resulting in gradual 
normalization of transaminases. This case highlights the importance of prompt 
drug discontinuation, use of structured drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
assessment tools, and adherence to geriatric prescribing guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
peptides. The neuroprotective protein sestrin-2 (SESN2) has been implicated in 
the cellular response to oxidative stress and autophagy, processes that are 
disrupted in AD. This study explores the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
(PDEIs) roflumilast (RF), rolipram (ROL), and tadalafil (TAD) on SESN2 
expression and autophagy in Aβ25-35-treated hippocampal neuron (HT-22) cell 
cultures.
METHODS: The HT-22 cells were exposed to 5 μM Aβ25-35 for 32 hours to induce 
AD-like pathology. Concurrently, cells were treated with PDEIs (ROL: 10 μM, TAD: 
1.53 nM, RF: 5 μM). The SESN2, autophagy-related proteins (ATG5, beclin-1 
(BECN1), LC3II), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and 
mTOR expression levels were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot techniques.
RESULTS: The Aβ25-35 exposure significantly increased SESN2 expression and 
altered the levels of autophagy-related proteins, resulting in decreased active 
AMPK (phosphorylated (p)-AMPK) and increased active mTOR (phosphorylated 
(p)-mTOR). Treatment with PDEIs reduced the elevated SESN2 expression and 
modulated autophagy-related protein levels, enhancing ATG5, BECN1, and LC3II 
expression. The PDEIs also restored p-AMPK levels and reduced p-mTOR expression 
in Aβ25-35-treated cells.
CONCLUSION: The PDEIs exhibit neuroprotective effects in an in vitro AD model by 
reducing SESN2 overexpression and modulating autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR 
pathway. These findings suggest that PDEIs could be potential therapeutic agents 
for AD, targeting SESN2 and autophagy pathways to mitigate neurodegenerative 
damage.

The FDA approval of disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease therapies marks a 
major shift in treatment but exposes a critical challenge: identifying patients 
during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage when intervention is most 
effective. Despite early biological changes, most diagnoses occur after 
significant decline. Drawing from over 180 stakeholder interviews conducted 
through the NSF I-Corps program reveal major detection gaps across primary care, 
specialty access, and available tools. This commentary highlights the 
consequences of delayed diagnosis and proposes translational strategies to align 
early detection with therapeutic opportunity, positioning MCI as the critical 
window for Alzheimer's disease intervention.

We report a 76-year-old patient with mild cognitive impairment and APOE ε3/ε3 
genotype who developed a rare pontine hemorrhage following treatment with 
lecanemab, an anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer's disease. She 
was initially on clopidogrel and rivaroxaban; rivaroxaban was discontinued prior 
to lecanemab initiation. After two infusions, lecanemab was paused due to 
angina. She then underwent coronary stenting and was placed on dual antiplatelet 
therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). Pontine hemorrhage occurred after twenty 
days. This case highlights heightened bleeding risk when lecanemab is combined 
with intensified antithrombotic therapy, even without APOE ε4 or significant 
cerebral small vessel disease load.

Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) is one of the most 
downregulated genes in the brain capillary endothelial cells derived from 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) significantly 
contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. We hypothesized that loss of BACE2 
increases production of ET-1 from human brain microvascular endothelial cells 
(BMECs). Genetic inactivation of BACE2 in cultured human BMECs significantly 
upregulated expression and release of ET-1. Mechanistic studies indicated that 
γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2/transforming growth factor beta 2 
signaling pathway mediated the effect of BACE2 inhibition on ET-1 production.

While mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a risk factor for dementia, it is 
currently impossible to predict which patients will go on to develop dementia or 
Alzheimer's disease. Given the projected global increase in dementia due to an 
increasingly aging population, there is an urgent need to develop 
pharmacological therapies to reduce symptoms of MCI, and to help delay its 
possible progression to dementia. Choline alphoscerate is a cholinergic 
precursor naturally found in the brain that has been identified as an essential 
nutrient and is available as a prescription drug. While the efficacy of choline 
alphoscerate on cognitive function is well established in patients with MCI, 
Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive impairment of vascular origin, emerging 
evidence suggests that it has neuroprotective effects against β-amyloid injury 
and may be useful as a preventive therapy against development of Alzheimer's 
disease in patients with MCI. Recent data also show that choline alphoscerate 
may be effective against non-cognitive symptoms of MCI (e.g., depression, 
anxiety, irritability, aggression, and apathy). Here we review pharmacological 
and clinical evidence regarding choline alphoscerate in order to highlight its 
usefulness in patients with MCI. The potential role of choline alphoscerate in 
promoting healthy sleep architecture is also explored.

BACKGROUND: The potential effect of the antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory 
properties of aspirin on Alzheimer's disease development, especially its role in 
the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease dementia, 
remains controversial. To evaluate the association between aspirin, use and the 
risk of conversion to Alzheimer's disease dementia among individuals diagnosed 
with mild cognitive impairment.
METHODS: In this retrospective population-based cohort study, we used the Korean 
National Health Insurance Service database to collect data on patients with mild 
cognitive impairment enrolled between 2013 and 2016 and followed up until 2021. 
In total, 508,107 patients initially diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment 
(192,538 with aspirin prescriptions and 315,569 without aspirin prescriptions) 
were enrolled. Aspirin use was assessed by extracting information from the 
Korean National Health Insurance Service database using aspirin prescription 
codes. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease dementia. 
Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for Alzheimer's disease were analyzed 
according to aspirin use using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. 
Secondary outcomes included ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk associated with 
aspirin use.
RESULTS: The data of 508,107 individuals were analyzed (mean [standard 
deviation] age, 67.6 [10.7] years; 66.8% women and 33.2% men), and 39,318 
developed Alzheimer's disease (22,572 controls and 16,746 using aspirin). The 
rate of conversion to Alzheimer's disease was lower in the aspirin user group, 
and the time to Alzheimer's disease dementia occurrence was longer than in the 
nonuser group. A decreased Alzheimer's disease dementia risk was found in 
patients using aspirin in Model 2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.939; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.920-0.959), with more pronounced effects in individuals aged 
≥65 years (Model 2 adjusted hazard ratio, 0.934; 95% confidence interval, 
0.914-0.955). For hemorrhagic stroke, the risk increased with aspirin use across 
all age groups, with the highest risk observed in younger patients (Model 2 
adjusted hazard ratio, 5.082; 95% confidence interval, 4.838-5.338).
CONCLUSION: Aspirin use was associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease risk in 
older patients with mild cognitive impairment. Notably, the bleeding risk 
associated with aspirin use should be considered, and personalized treatment 
should be provided.

INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in disease-modifying drugs, better treatments for 
symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed, with dopaminergic 
neurotransmission representing a potential target. The objective of this 
systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of drugs with 
predominantly dopaminergic action in improving cognitive symptoms in AD.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched 
from 1980 to January 2023. We used random effect models to generate pooled 
effect estimates.
RESULTS: We included 19 prospective randomized controlled AD trials (1408 total 
participants), of which 7 were of "good" quality, 8 "fair," and 4 "poor." All 
were included in the analysis. The overall pooled effect was small but showed a 
significant positive effect of dopaminergic drugs compared to placebo 
(standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08 to 
0.59, P = 0.01; I 2 = 79%). Significance remained after removing outliers to 
account for heterogeneity. When exploring subgroups (divided by mechanism of 
action), 5 trials of dopamine reuptake inhibitors did not show a significant 
effect on cognition, whereas 12 monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor trials 
showed a moderately significant positive effect (SMD: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.13 to 
0.90, P = 0.01; I 2 = 84%).
DISCUSSION: We show evidence of the benefit of dopaminergic medications, 
specifically MAO-B inhibitors, on cognitive symptoms in AD. Several studies 
included here also used drugs with both noradrenergic and dopaminergic action, 
highlighting a potential dual stimulation that could lead to better clinical 
efficacy. Trials targeting well-defined patient populations, ideally supported 
by biomarker evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction, are needed to compare 
noradrenergic and dopaminergic agents-both separately and in combination-on 
cognitive function to maximize treatment effects. Particularly, further research 
should explore the impact of MAO-B drugs on specific aspects of cognitive 
function to better understand their mechanism given the upregulation of MAO-B 
expression in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted a meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of 
dopaminergic drugs in improving cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).Our findings highlight the potential cognitive benefits of dopaminergic 
medications, particularly monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, in AD.Future trials 
are warranted and could focus on biomarker-defined patient groups to enhance 
effectiveness.

BackgroundAgitation is a frequent and distressing neuropsychiatric symptom in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), often leading to increased caregiver 
burden, institutionalization, and healthcare costs. While antipsychotics are 
commonly prescribed, their use is limited by safety concerns. Selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram and escitalopram, have 
emerged as alternative treatments with a more favorable safety profile. This 
study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these agents in the 
management of agitation in AD.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing citalopram or 
escitalopram with placebo or other pharmacological treatments in older adults 
with AD and clinically defined agitation. Primary outcomes included changes in 
agitation severity, assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Rating 
(NPI-C) and the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS). Secondary outcomes included 
cognitive function (MMSE), anxiety symptoms, and adverse events. Standardized 
mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio (RR) were pooled using a random-effects 
model.ResultsFour RCTs comprising 502 patients were included. Pooled analysis 
showed no significant improvement in agitation severity (SMD -0.67; 95% CI 
-2.58, 1.25; I2 = 98.3%) or cognitive outcomes (SMD 2.43; 95% CI -2.55, 7.41). 
Rates of serious adverse events (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.50, 1.45) and treatment 
discontinuation (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.80, 1.37) were similar between groups. 
However, SSRI use was associated with an increased risk of falls (RR 1.78; 95% 
CI 1.15, 2.75; I2 = 0%).ConclusionEscitalopram and citalopram do not 
significantly reduce agitation in AD but are generally well tolerated. Increased 
fall risk warrants cautious clinical use.Registration PROSPERO protocol

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of 
senile plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and the intraneuronal 
accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles composed of abnormal, 
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. These act in concert to drive cognitive 
decline, but it is widely held that tau spread correlates better with cognitive 
decline than does amyloid burden. Control of AD neuropathologies with active 
immunizations is studied as a potential therapeutic avenue because it could 
build innate immunity. Although most active immunization studies have focused on 
Aβ targets, tau and other targets continue to be explored.
AREAS COVERED: This study aimed to identify and describe non-Aβ active 
immunization trials for AD treatment. A narrative review was conducted to 
analyze the current status of non-Aβ active immunization for AD using PubMed as 
the research database.
EXPERT OPINION: The potential of active immunization beyond Aβ was explored as a 
therapeutic strategy for AD with a focus that targets tau and provides insights 
into its effectiveness, associated challenges, and limitations. Results from 
preclinical and clinical studies were examined, highlighting the progress and 
the hurdles that exist. Active immunization against non-Aβ targets, such as tau, 
for the treatment of AD remains a promising and expanding field.

Divergent Synthesis of ΔAA-Peptides Using a Bioorthogonal pro-Amino Acid and 
Aqueous Flavin Photocatalyst: Green Light Enhances Catalyst Performance and 
Product Selectivity.

Dehydroamino acids (ΔAAs) are vital building blocks in the design and 
optimization of peptide drugs. The exact olefin geometry, side chain chemotype, 
and ancillary β-carbon substituents play a significant role. Unfortunately, 
general approaches to install these motifs into peptides are lacking, 
complicated by the instability of unsaturated residues during traditional 
amide-bond coupling and failure of divergent protocols, such as oxidative Heck 
and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons, to accommodate a complete range of substrate 
classes. Herein, we conceive and interrogate an original bioorthogonal reagent, 
β-sulfonyldehydroamino acid (ΔSulf), that can be site-specifically encoded into 
standard peptides through solid- or liquid-phase synthesis. When combined with 
an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, myriad boronic acids and 525 nm light-a more 
biologically benign portion of the flavin visible absorption spectra that has 
not previously been exploited for flavin photoredox catalysis,-this latent 
residue becomes one of several (Z)-ΔAA variants (aromatic, heteroaromatic, 
aliphatic) via stereoretentive radical conjugate addition and β-scission. The 
importance of green light is established through mechanistic studies showing 
that it tempers radical formation and discourages flavin-catalyzed 
isomerization, controlling product selectivity. We apply our original reagent 
and catalytic platform in a brief medicinal chemistry campaign to discover 
tetrapeptides that modulate Aβ42 aggregation for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease.

With the acceleration of global population aging, effective strategies for the 
prevention and management of aging-related diseases have become increasingly 
urgent. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a pattern 
recognition receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a central 
regulatory role in the pathogenesis of chronic conditions such as diabetes and 
Alzheimer's disease. By binding to a wide range of ligands (e.g., advanced 
glycation end products, amyloid beta), RAGE activates key inflammatory and 
stress-related signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, positioning it as a 
critical therapeutic target. This review systematically examines RAGE-ligand 
interactions and their downstream signaling cascades, and proposes targeted 
intervention strategies. Special emphasis is placed on the regulatory potential 
of dietary bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, and 
terpenoids, highlighting the distinct advantages of functional foods in 
anti-aging applications. In line with the World Health Organization's concept of 
"preventive aging," dietary-based approaches offer a long-term, safe, and 
integrative means of providing both nutritional support and disease prevention. 
This review provides a theoretical foundation for the development of 
RAGE-targeted dietary interventions and supports a paradigm shift from medical 
treatment to nutritional prevention in anti-aging strategies.

BACKGROUND: The present study examined the effect of a behavioral weight loss 
intervention on multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity, as measured by 
neurofilament light chain (NfL).
METHODS: NfL samples were collected at each clinical visit. Treatment and 
control arms were collapsed to perform cross-sectional analyses among the 
pre-intervention sample (n = 65). Spearman Rho correlations were used to examine 
associations between adjusted (age/BMI) and unadjusted pre-intervention NfL 
levels, and patient anthropometric, demographic, clinical, and 
treatment-specific variables (i.e., diet, physical activity). Mann-Whitney U 
Test was used to examine differences in NfL change between groups (intervention 
vs. control) at 6-months. Longitudinal associations between NfL change and 
percent weight loss, diet, and physical activity were also assessed among the 
collapsed sample.
RESULTS: Participant age was the only variable associated with NfL at baseline. 
Change in age/BMI adjusted NfL did not significantly differ between groups at 6 
months (U = 201, p = .25). Despite clinically significant weight loss, there 
were no statistically significant differences between pre-/post-treatment levels 
or pre-/post-maintenance levels of NfL. Changes in diet and physical activity 
were not associated with changes in NfL.
DISCUSSION: NfL remained stable throughout the intervention despite significant 
weight loss. In this cohort, weight loss was associated with improved mobility, 
quality of life, and increased physical activity (Bruce et al., 2023). These 
improvements may have been due to the weight loss itself and possibly not due to 
a reduction in MS-related disease activity that is indexed by change in NfL.

In pursuit of developing advanced neuroprotective agents for neurodegenerative 
disorders, we rationally designed a series of novel hybrid molecules through 
structural integration of a vitamin K derivative with well-known antioxidants 
(ferulic acid, melatonin, α-lipoic acid, and Trolox, respectively). Systematic 
pharmacological evaluation revealed that most hybrids exhibited superior 
antioxidant activity in both DPPH radical scavenging and ORAC assays. Among 
these, a Trolox-vitamin K conjugate (compound 16e) emerged as a promising 
compound, demonstrating exceptional neuroprotective efficacy across multiple 
neuronal injury models, including oxytosis, ferroptosis, and ATP depletion in 
HT22 hippocampal neurons. Mechanistic studies confirmed that this compound 
preserved synergistic cytoprotective effects of its parent pharmacophores 
against ferroptosis while concurrently exhibiting immunomodulatory activity in 
microglial cells. Notably, it significantly ameliorated Aβ25-35-induced 
cognitive deficits in a murine Alzheimer's disease model at a very low dose 
(0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), outperforming conventional neuroprotectants in therapeutic 
potency. These findings position this Trolox/vitamin K hybrid molecule as a 
neuroprotective candidate with translational potential for treating 
neurodegenerative pathologies.

BACKGROUND: The dementia landscape has evolved, with earlier diagnoses, improved 
prevention understanding (eg, modifiable factors), and new treatments. Emerging 
digital technologies (eg, wearables, smart home systems, and mobile apps) offer 
self‑management opportunities; yet, gaps persist regarding integration into the 
care needs and preferences of people with dementia. Broader gaps remain 
concerning intervention design; adaptation; and implementation, including 
effectiveness, study quality, and accessibility.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to synthesize and critically appraise 
existing literature on digital self-management technologies (wearables, smart 
home systems, and mobile apps) intended to reduce dementia-associated behaviors, 
enhance self-management, and improve quality of life (QoL). It evaluates 
intervention characteristics, effectiveness, accessibility, study design, and 
methodological quality according to international standards.
METHODS: A systematic search across 9 databases (PubMed, Scopus, ACM Digital 
Library, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Embase, and MEDLINE) 
identified relevant English‑language studies published between January 1, 2013, 
and September 30, 2023. Search terms covered dementia, QoL, behavioral and 
self‑management strategies, and digital technologies. Eligible studies involved 
adults with dementia using wearable, smart home, or mobile technologies 
targeting QoL, behavior, and autonomy. Two reviewers independently appraised 
study design, hardware, and intervention purpose. Outcomes were mapped to the 
Nursing Outcomes Classification and benchmarked against National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence quality standard 184. Accessibility was evaluated by 
availability, cost, usability, and context. Bias mitigation included a PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)‑guided 
strategy and PROSPERO registration. Methodological quality and bias were 
assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, the Critical Appraisal Skills 
Program, and a bespoke characterization framework.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies evaluated interventions based on wearables, smart 
home systems, or apps for people with dementia and carers. Outcomes centered on 
neurocognition (24/24, 100%), self-care (17/24, 71%), and health behavior 
(13/24, 54%). Identified needs included managing distress (15/24, 62%) and 
supporting carers (15/24, 62%). Technologies included commercial tools (activity 
trackers, health-based wearables, and digital prompters) but were often 
inaccessible due to complex setup requirements and ongoing support needs. 
Substantial methodological heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, necessitating 
narrative synthesis. Study quality was generally good to excellent, but samples 
were small, reporting incomplete, and outcomes unblinded. Only 1 (17%) of 6 
randomized controlled trials reported effect sizes, indicating moderate decline 
in QoL at 24 months; effectiveness in other studies remains uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: Research on digital technologies for dementia self‑management shows 
benefits, particularly with off‑the‑shelf devices and mobile apps supporting 
person‑centered outcomes. Notable limitations include inadequate participant 
diversity (eg, atypical dementias and minoritized populations) and insufficient 
high‑quality research on QoL and behavioral outcomes, such as symptom management 
and self‑control. Future research must prioritize innovative solutions enhancing 
accessibility and usability, emphasizing simplified configuration, personalized 
adaptability, and effective training and support structures.

Advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, and large-scale clinical studies have 
significantly expanded our understanding how human health is shaped by the 
microorganisms that colonize the body since birth. This article explores the 
rapidly evolving field of human microbiome research, focusing upon how microbial 
communities influence neurological health and contribute to the development of 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Multiple factors, including age, lifestyle, 
and immunological memory, are recognized as major determinants of an 
individual's microbiome composition, which in turn can influence the onset and 
the progression of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These conditions have 
been linked to mechanisms including the aggregation of pathogenic proteins 
(e.g., amyloid-β and α-synuclein), inflammation driven by activation of the 
Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, the NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as 
the modulatory effect of microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The article also highlights ongoing 
research and emerging strategies aimed at leveraging the human microbiome for 
better diagnosis, and management of NDs.

INTRODUCTION: Here we contrast cognitive outcomes of deep brain stimulation 
(DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to isolate the 
shared effect of DBS upon cognition while filtering out disease-specific 
effects. Based on prior literature, we evaluate how DBS connectivity to the 
hippocampus influences cognition. We then evaluate how patient factors moderate 
this relationship.
METHODS: We studied electrode locations and cognitive outcomes in patients who 
received subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS for PD (2 datasets: n = 33, n = 28) or 
fornix DBS for AD (1 dataset: n = 46). We then investigate the moderating effect 
of patient factors and similarities across diseases.
RESULTS: DBS site connectivity to the hippocampus was cognitively deleterious in 
PD but beneficial in AD. The opposite findings were driven by patient age. This 
effect was mediated by age-related hippocampal atrophy.
DISCUSSION: The shared cognitive effects of DBS across PD and AD depend on 
hippocampal connectivity and age.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognition can be positively or negatively modulated in the same 
manner across diseases. Contrary to current clinical practice, older Parkinson's 
disease (PD) patients may benefit from deep brain stimulation (DBS). Our results 
support limiting enrollment to patients over 65 for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
DBS, an emerging therapy currently in a phase 3 clinical trial. Hippocampal 
volume mediates the impact of DBS, suggesting patient atrophy must be considered 
in patient-specific care.

Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a range of chronic diseases marked by the 
progressive loss of structure or function of the nervous system, particularly 
within areas of the brain such as the neurons (or nerve cells). This 
degeneration leads to a decline in cognitive abilities, motor skills, and other 
neurological functions. The progression can be gradual, occurring over years or 
even decades, and often leads to significant disability and, ultimately, death. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent degenerative disease that affects 
cognition and that rises dramatically with age. It is a progressive, chronic 
disease that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die. Current treatments 
largely address symptoms without altering or reversing disease progression. 
However, recent advancements with amyloid-β (Aβ) antibodies validate Aβ as a 
therapeutic target for AD. This article details my long-term experience as a 
medicinal chemist and project leader working on γ-secretase, a key target in AD 
drug discovery. I will share initial insights from a multi-disciplinary effort 
to discover a disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

Protein-protein interactions are at the heart of biological processes. 
Understanding how proteins interact is key for deciphering their roles in health 
and disease, and for therapeutic interventions. However, identifying protein 
interaction sites, especially for intrinsically disordered proteins, is 
challenging. Here, we developed a deep learning framework to predict potential 
protein binding sites to 14-3-3 - a 'central hub' protein holding a key role in 
cellular signaling networks. After systematically testing multiple deep learning 
approaches to predict sequence binding to 14-3-3, we developed an ensemble model 
that achieved a 75% balanced accuracy on external sequences. Our approach was 
applied prospectively to identify putative binding sites across medically 
relevant proteins (ranging from highly structured to intrinsically disordered) 
for a total of approximately 300 sequences. The top eight predicted peptide 
sequences were experimentally validated in the wet-lab, and binding to 14-3-3 
was confirmed for five out of eight sequences (K d ranging from 1.6 ± 0.1 μM to 
70 ± 5 μM). The relevance of our results was further confirmed by X-ray 
crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations. These sequences represent 
potential new binding sites within the 14-3-3 interactome (e.g., relating to 
Alzheimer's disease as the binding to tau is not the new part), and provide 
opportunities to investigate their functional relevance. Our results highlight 
the ability of deep learning to capture intricate patterns underlying 
protein-protein interactions, even for challenging cases like intrinsically 
disordered proteins. To further the understanding and targeting of 
14-3-3/protein interactions, our model was provided as a freely accessible web 
resource at the following URL: https://14-3-3-bindsite.streamlit.app/.

Psychotropics are currently developed and marketed with a limited understanding 
of their mechanism of action. The notion that protein kinase C (PKC) activity is 
highly relevant to learning and memory function stems from experiments in the 
1980s, which associated protein kinase alpha (pka) and pkc to animal models of 
associative learning, opening an area of exploration for psychotropic 
development. The PKC family consists of several isoforms, including PKC alpha, 
beta1, beta1, gamma, delta and epsilon among others. In particular, PKC gamma 
(PRKCG) is highly brain-expressed and is singled out as a candidate for 
modulation in psychiatric illness. With hundreds of identified substrates, PRKCG 
affects multiple pathways relevant for regulation of neuronal health. In this 
review, converging lines of evidence are presented in the context of 
psychotropic drug action, which point to downregulation of PKC activity as a 
potential common mechanism across several psychiatric disorders. Using this 
mechanism through more targeted psychotropic action may then be used to develop 
agents that further ameliorate psychiatric symptom expression. Psychotropics 
including fluoxetine, tricyclics, lithium, valproate, ketamine and others are 
explored in relation to their effect of PKC, finding that across all drugs 
examined, a downregulation with chronic-but not acute-use constitutes their 
putative effect in ameliorating symptoms. This effect is compounded by findings 
that suggest that PKCs, and PRKCG in particular, promote neuroplastic effects by 
their downregulation. This effect is in contrast to PKC activators, which have 
been used in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. 
Cross-disorder mechanisms need to continue to be explored in neuropsychiatric 
illness and targeted treatments developed in turn to address treatment-resistant 
conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term, progressive, degenerative disorder. One 
of the most important pathological characteristics of AD is the deposition of 
β-amyliod (Aβ) peptide, which initiates a spectrum of cerebral 
neuroinflammation. Vascular changes also play an important role in the 
pathophysiology of the disease. Cytokines, secreted by immune cells, can 
facilitate cell-to-cell signaling and influence the functions of the central 
nervous system (CNS). These important mediators of the immune system, which are 
known to orchestrate various molecular and cellular mechanisms in both 
physiological and pathological situations, can be upregulated or downregulated, 
leading to a complex crosstalk with numerous receptors mediating 
pro-inflammatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. In particular, the 
interleukin (IL)-1 family of cytokines has been implicated to significantly 
correlate with AD pathogenesis among other cytokines in the CNS. The IL-1 family 
of cytokines is essential in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. This 
pleiotropic family of cytokines includes IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist 
(RA), IL-18, IL-33, IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ, IL-36RA, IL-37, and IL-38. Recent 
studies have demonstrated that the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
such as IL-1α and IL-1β, or the downregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators, 
exerts multifaceted influences on both neurodegeneration and neuroprotection. 
The lack of effective treatment for AD necessitates the search for new drugs 
that target several processes in the disease's pathology. This review aims to 
give a comprehensive overview of the emerging roles of the IL-1 family of 
cytokines in AD pathology and to explain their perspectives on introducing novel 
strategies for effective therapeutic/neuropsychiatric management of AD in 
clinical settings by discussing both the pathogenic and protective roles of 
these cytokines.

Daidzein, a soy-derived isoflavone, has gained significant attention due to its 
diverse pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
and estrogenic activities. This review synthesizes current research on 
daidzein's biological effects, focusing on its role in chronic diseases, such as 
cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative 
conditions. Mechanistically, daidzein exerts its effects through estrogen 
receptor modulation, activation of antioxidant pathways, and regulation of 
inflammatory mediators. Studies have demonstrated its potential in inhibiting 
cancer cell proliferation, improving bone mineral density, and reducing 
oxidative stress in cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, daidzein's 
neuroprotective effects suggest promise in managing neurodegenerative disorders 
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Despite its therapeutic potential, the 
bioavailability and metabolism of daidzein remain critical challenges, with 
interindividual variability influencing its efficacy. Advances in nanotechnology 
and formulation strategies aim to enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic 
applications. This review underscores the need for well-designed clinical trials 
to validate daidzein's efficacy and safety across different populations. Future 
research should also explore synergistic effects with other bioactive compounds 
to maximize its clinical utility.

OBJECTIVES: Alterations in auditory evoked potential (AEP) parameters have been 
associated with sensory memory deficits and may serve as biomarkers for 
cognitive decline. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate 
the effectiveness of AEPs in the early detection of Alzheimer disease (AD).
DESIGN: The systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive 
search was performed across five electronic databases (EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane 
Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and CINAHL) from their inception until August 
2024, without restrictions on date or language. The methodological quality of 
evidence was assessed using the Crew Critical Appraisal Tool. Data were 
extracted on the latency and amplitude of five AEP components, including 
auditory P50 gating, mismatch negativity, and late-latency responses (N100, 
N200, P300), comparing patients with AD to age-matched control peers.
RESULTS: Out of 437 publications, 54 articles were selected for review, with 
most rated as having high methodological quality. The analysis revealed a 
significantly larger P50 gating amplitude (p < 0.001) in patients with AD. 
Furthermore, patients with AD demonstrated significantly prolonged latencies and 
reduced amplitudes for N100, N200, and P300 components (p ≤ 0.001) compared with 
controls. Among all AEPs, P300 latency exhibited the largest effect size. Funnel 
plot analysis and Egger's regression test showed no evidence of publication 
bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the clinical utility of AEPs in early AD 
detection, with the P300 response identified as the most accurate 
electrophysiological measure for distinguishing patients with AD from the 
control group. These results highlight the value of incorporating AEPs into 
clinical assessment protocols to enhance early-stage AD diagnosis and 
monitoring, thereby facilitating timely interventions and the development of 
personalized treatment strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges for the elderly, leading 
to cognitive decline, social isolation, and lower quality of life. Current 
interventions often require cumbersome wearable devices e.g. the camera-based 
monitoring that may raise privacy concerns. However, these issues are not fully 
addressed previously. To fill this gap, this research proposes a new framework 
in non-invasive combination of Virtual Reality (VR), Voice recognition, and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to act as a supportive system for people with AD. 
The system provides a brand-new approach that tailored cognitive stimulation and 
companionship through the immersive VR scenarios, memory games, virtual trips, 
and an AI assistant together as a single platform. The AI-based assessment of 
the patient is employed to ensure that the experience is more relevant and 
helpful to the patient. The voice recognition is the most simple and easy 
user-interface. The security measures include access controls, encryption and 
continuous monitoring of cloud patient data. The initial study has been 
promising evidenced by the outcome of involving patients with Alzheimer's and 
dementia, their families, and clinicians. Participants reported heightened 
interest, better quality of life, less sense of isolation, and improved 
cognitive functioning, which have particularly achieved one of our goals, in 
patients' well-beings in mental healthcare. The research indicates a significant 
step forward enhancing the quality of support for both cognitive function and 
social interaction for older adults with AD and dementia. In comparison with 
other currently existing systems, our newly developed integrated framework has 
made additional contributions to the areas of AD in dynamic cognitive 
adaptation, bilingual interaction, and secure real-time personalized system.

Light can serve as a tunable trigger for neurobioengineering technologies, 
enabling probing, control, and enhancement of brain function with unmatched 
spatiotemporal precision. Yet, these technologies often require genetic or 
structural alterations of neurons, disrupting their natural activity. Here, we 
introduce the Graphene-Mediated Optical Stimulation (GraMOS) platform, which 
leverages graphene's optoelectronic properties and its ability to efficiently 
convert light into electricity. Using GraMOS in longitudinal studies, we found 
that repeated optical stimulation enhances the maturation of hiPSC-derived 
neurons and brain organoids, underscoring GraMOS's potential for regenerative 
medicine and neurodevelopmental studies. To explore its potential for disease 
modeling, we applied short-term GraMOS to Alzheimer's stem cell models, 
uncovering disease-associated alterations in neuronal activity. Finally, we 
demonstrated a proof-of-concept for neuroengineering applications by directing 
robotic movements with GraMOS-triggered signals from graphene-interfaced brain 
organoids. By enabling precise, non-invasive neural control across timescales 
from milliseconds to months, GraMOS opens new avenues in neurodevelopment, 
disease treatment, and robotics.

INTRODUCTION: Psychosis is frequently observed in patients with 
neurodegenerative disease and may precede onset of cognitive symptoms. 
Additionally, the presence of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease is often 
associated with adverse effects including increased progression of cognitive 
decline and conversion to dementia, increased caregiver burden, and increased 
rates of placement in long-term care. Moreover, existing pharmacological 
treatments, which consist principally of off-label antipsychotic medications, 
may be associated with increased risk of harm, making management of symptoms 
challenging.
OBJECTIVE: We review recent advances in the field of psychosis in 
neurodegenerative disease, including advances in clinical criteria, biomarkers 
(neuroimaging, pathology, and genomic and epigenomics), and treatments.
METHOD: Under the direction of the International Psychogeriatric Association 
(IPA), a task force comprised of experts in the field of psychosis in 
neurodegenerative disease was convened. An in-person meeting was organized in 
September 2024, coincident with the annual IPA Congress. The task force 
undertook a review of the literature in the areas of clinical care, biomarkers, 
and treatment, from which key recommendations for the management and future 
investigation of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease were derived.
RESULTS: It was concluded that psychosis in neurodegenerative disease has a 
characteristic phenomenology that despite sharing some features with 
schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders, may differ in other clinically 
meaningful aspects. Etiopathogenesis based on biomarker, genomic, and treatment 
studies may differ to some extent among neurodegenerative diseases. There is 
emerging evidence supporting the use of prescriptive non-pharmacological (WHELD 
intervention) and novel pharmacological (pimavanserin, muscarinic agonists) 
approaches in the treatment of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease.
CONCLUSION: Future directions include the need for the implementation of 
evidence-based nonpharmacological treatments consistent with the aims of 
precision medicine, further investigation into novel pharmacological agents, 
mapping specific psychotic symptoms to specific biomarkers, and further 
exploration of the link between psychosis in neurodegenerative disease and other 
late-life psychoses.

We herein report a case of amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA)-E/H 
following lecanemab treatment in a 70-year-old man with mild cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Generalized seizures occurred after the 
third infusion and were accompanied by FLAIR hyperintensity, microbleeds, and a 
minor acute infarct. Amyloid PET revealed focal clearance of amyloid plaques in 
the ARIA-affected regions. CSF Aβ40 levels transiently decreased by ~30% during 
the ARIA episode, whereas Aβ42 remained stable, thereby increasing the Aβ42/40 
ratio. These findings suggest that ARIA may facilitate focal amyloid clearance 
and that CSF Aβ40 reduction may serve as a potential biomarker for ARIA onset 
and resolution.

BACKGROUND: Lipid profiles are largely determined by genetic variants, and lipid 
metabolism plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether lipid profile variability in response to 
diverse statins could be affected by cholesterol metabolism-related genetic 
variants in Alzheimer's disease..
DESIGN AND SETTING: This prospective observational pharmacogenetic study was 
conducted at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), Brazil.
METHODS: Consecutive outpatients were prospectively followed for lipid profile 
variations over one year, estimated by the associations between statin therapy 
and the following variants: rs2695121 (NR1H2), rs3846662 (HMGCR), rs11669576 
(LDLR8), rs5930 (LDLR10), rs5882 and rs708272 (CETP), rs7412 and rs429358 
(APOE), and ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism.
RESULTS: All polymorphisms in the 189 patients were in Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium. Statins resulted in lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
levels, whereas the effects on HDL cholesterol varied according to the statin 
used. Atorvastatin resulted in lower triglyceride level variations than 
simvastatin. APOE-ε4 carriers showed a better response to atorvastatin in 
elevating HDL-cholesterol than APOE-ε4 non-carriers. Carriers of the ACE 
insertion allele had cumulatively lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol 
levels, regardless of statin therapy, but lower triglyceride levels when using 
atorvastatin. Carriers of rs11669576-G had lower total cholesterol and 
LDL-cholesterol levels when using simvastatin, and lower total cholesterol and 
triglycerides when using atorvastatin. Concerning CETP haplotypes, carriers of 
rs5882-A and rs708272-A benefitted the most from statins, which lowered total 
cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol levels, and from atorvastatin lowering 
triglycerides; however, the effects of atorvastatin lowering total cholesterol 
and LDL-cholesterol were more pronounced for carriers of rs5882-GG/rs708272-GG.
CONCLUSION: Lipid profile variations may be pharmacogenetically mediated in 
Alzheimer's disease, thus, confirming their high heritability.

From Symptomatic to Pre-symptomatic: Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Early 
Alzheimer's Detection Using Functional MRI.

Wei Y, Abrol A, Lah J, Levey AI, Calhoun VD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses from asymptomatic changes to clinical 
symptoms, underscoring the critical need for early detection to facilitate 
timely treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers 
non-invasive biomarkers for detection, but current methods fail to reliably 
identify pre-symptomatic individuals due to two key challenges: (1) Subtle, 
anatomically distinct fMRI patterns in pre-symptomatic cases that resemble 
healthy controls more than symptomatic patients, and (2) Severe class imbalance 
in real-world data, where healthy controls vastly outnumber pre-symptomatic 
subjects. To address this, we reconceptualize AD diagnosis as a multi-stage 
distillation task, where insights from easier-to-detect symptomatic cases guide 
pre-symptomatic detection. We propose a novel margin-aware knowledge 
distillation (KD) framework with two innovations: (1) We leverage Unbalanced 
Optimal Transport (UOT) for Feature Distillation to flexibly adapt to anatomical 
differences in brain patterns caused by neurodegeneration and ensure effective 
distillation from later to earlier disease stages. (2) We propose 
Self-Distillation with Dynamic Margins to combat class imbalance by adaptively 
refining the classification boundary. We evaluate our proposed framework across 
four distinct base models and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art 
KD methods. Additionally, we show the significance of various brain regions in 
identifying pre-symptomatic subjects, as well as how features are transferred 
during distillation. These contributions advance the development of more precise 
diagnostic tools and foster a deeper understanding of early disease 
manifestations, marking a significant stride towards more reliable and earlier 
AD diagnosis.

Exosomes are nano vesicles secreted by the cells that play an essential role in 
intercellular communication, enabling the transport of bioactive molecules, 
including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Among them, plant-derived 
exosome-like nanovesicles have attracted considerable interest due to their 
prospective therapeutic implications, especially for neurological disorders. 
This article provides an overview of the biogenesis of plant-derived 
exosome-like nanovesicles, compares their characteristics with mammalian-derived 
exosomes, and investigates their bioavailability and chemical composition. The 
article also discusses the mechanisms through which they are uptaken by cells, 
highlighting several cellular uptake pathways and their significance for 
targeted drug delivery. Moreover, it explains the molecular basis of 
neurological disorders and investigates how plant-derived exosome-like 
nanovesicles regulate intracellular signaling pathways, providing potential 
therapeutic benefits. Finally, it provides the latest advancements in 
engineering research, emphasizing biochemical modifications on the exosomal 
surface, loading therapeutic molecules into exosomes, and exosomes derived from 
genetically engineered plants, for more effective therapies in neurological 
disorders.

Design of Red Fluorescence Ce-Based Carbon Dots of High and Balanced Multiple 
Functions against Alzheimer's β-Amyloid Fibrillization.

The intricate pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by 
β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, presents 
significant challenges for conventional single-target therapeutic approaches, 
thereby necessitating the development of innovative multifunctional theranostic 
strategies. Herein, red fluorescence cerium-based carbon dots (CCP-CD) were 
designed and synthesized via a one-step solvothermal method by purposely 
selecting curcumin (Cur) for inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects, 
Ce(NO3)3·6H2O for enhancing antioxidant activity, and p-phenylenediamine (p-PD) 
for modulating fluorescence property as precursors. The as-prepared CCP-CD 
potently suppressed Aβ fibrillization and strongly eliminated multiple reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) (·OH, O2·-, DPPH·) at low concentrations (1-10 μg/mL). 
Moreover, CCP-CD facilitates detection of Aβ plaques through a turn-on red 
fluorescence mechanism for both in vitro and in vivo imaging and quantification. 
In vitro assays showed that CCP-CD markedly attenuated Aβ-induced cytotoxicity 
and increased cell viability from ∼60 to 95%, as well as exhibited excellent 
anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in BV-2 
cells. In vivo experiments revealed that CCP-CD effectively suppressed Aβ plaque 
formation in the AD nematodes and prolonged the lifespan from 13 to 20 d. The 
unique structural characteristics of CCP-CD, including its conjugated aromatic 
framework, reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pair, and abundant O- and N-containing 
functional groups, facilitate balanced multiple therapeutic and diagnostic 
functions. The work has thus provided an exceptional nanoagent for detecting Aβ 
and fighting against Aβ-associated toxicities.

an urgent need for novel therapeutic agents, as existing drugs have limited 
efficacy and notable adverse effects. Chromenones, known for their diverse 
biological activities, have emerged as promising drug candidates for AD 
treatment due to their capacity to target multiple enzymes. In this study, 
investigated the chromenone derivative 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) as a potential 
multi-target inhibitor of key AD targets, highlighting the importance of the 
scaffold in target-based drug design.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 8-MOP, a phytochemical extracted and isolated from parsley 
leaves, was utilized to synthesize new derivatives, which were then screened 
against enzymes involved in AD progression (BACE1, AChE, BuChE) and targets 
involved in oxidative pathways (DPPH, NO). In support of the in vitro activity, 
in silico ADMET predictions and docking experiments were performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the synthesized compounds, 3d and 3e demonstrated 
significant inhibitory effects against the chosen targets, exhibiting IC50 
values between 5.8 ± 0.13 μM and 13 ± 0.12 μM. Furthermore, the docking 
experiments showed important binding interactions of these compounds with BACE1, 
AChE, and BuChE. The study demonstrates the potential of 8-MOP derivatives for 
targeting AD drug targets.

Autophagy dysregulation serves as a significant pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), with transcription factor EB (TFEB) acting as a pivotal 
transcription factor that governs the process of autophagy. Atractylenolide III 
(AT-III), a terpenoid compound found in medicinal Atractylodes macrocephala 
Koidz, is well-known for its role in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
activities. The purpose of this study is to explore the beneficial impact of 
AT-III on AD pathology and identify the mechanisms involved. C. elegans CL4176, 
SH-SY5Y APPSWE, and APP/PS1 mice were used to investigate the efficacy and 
possible mechanism of AT-III on the treatment of AD. AT-III reduced amyloid 
protein (Aβ) deposition in C. elegans CL4176 heads, prolonged the paralysis 
time, and reduced Aβ levels in SH-SY5Y APPSWE cells. AT-III improved the 
learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice and decreased the deposition of Aβ 
plaques. Transcriptomics and experimental validation showed that AT-III 
stimulated transcription and translation of autolysosome-associated genes. 
AT-III enhanced co-localization of LC3 and LAMP2 with Aβ in APP/PS1 mice. 
Meanwhile, AT-III increased TFEB transcriptional activity, mRNA, and protein 
levels in the nucleus. Furthermore, AT-III enhanced the expression of Yin Yang 1 
(YY1) protein, an upstream regulator of TFEB, and led to the stimulation of 
autophagy and lysosome biogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. The observed 
effects were reversed upon silencing YY1. AT-III may regulate the YY1-TFEB 
pathway, thereby restoring autophagy flux disturbances and ameliorating 
AD-related pathological changes and cognitive decline. This study provides a 
promising lead compound for intervention in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disease 
that disproportionately affects women. This study aimed to investigate 
sex-specific single lipids associated with AD.
METHODS: Plasma samples from 841 participants, comprising 306 individuals with 
AD, 165 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 370 cognitively healthy 
controls were curated from the AddNeuroMed cohort. Lipidomics identified 268 
single lipids for each sample. We investigated sex-specific associations from 
lipid modules and single lipids to AD and probed for causality with mediation 
analyses.
RESULTS: Three modules associated with AD in the female subset and one in the 
male subset (P < 0.05). In the female participants with AD, lipid families 
containing highly unsaturated fatty acids were reduced and those containing 
saturated lipids were increased (q value < 0.05). The effects of unsaturated 
phospholipids on AD were not mediated via cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, 
or apolipoprotein B.
DISCUSSION: Women with AD have lower unsaturated plasma lipid levels compared to 
controls.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lipid profiling showed lipid changes associated with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) exclusively in women. Women with AD had fewer highly unsaturated 
lipids and more saturated lipids. Unsaturated phospholipids affected AD 
independently of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, or apolipoprotein B. 
Sex-stratified analysis is key to understanding the different manifestations of 
AD.

BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) of presumed vascular origin are 
common in the elderly and are associated with vascular risk factors. There is 
evidence that vascular risk factors, in particular hypertension, are associated 
with WMH in particular locations of the white matter. However, it remains 
unclear whether this is true for all risk factors and whether signature WMH 
locations differ between risk factors. We aimed to identify WMH locations 
associated with vascular risk factors in community-dwelling individuals.
METHODS: We pooled cross-sectional data from 16 population-based cohorts (15 653 
individuals; mean age, 64.2±11.8 years; 52.2% female) through the Meta VCI Map 
Consortium. We quantified associations between WMH volumes in 50 white matter 
regions and 6 vascular risk factors using linear mixed models. Analyses were 
corrected for age, sex, study site, and total WMH volume.
RESULTS: Hypertension (B=0.141; P<0.001), smoking (B=0.096; P<0.001), diabetes 
(B=0.059; P<0.001), and history of vascular disease (B=0.056; P=0.034) were 
significantly associated with higher total WMH volume, whereas obesity (B=0.023; 
P=0.139) and hypercholesterolemia (B=0.009; P=0.531) were not. After correcting 
for total WMH volume, hypertension was associated with WMH volume in 10 regions 
(ie, bilateral external capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior 
corona radiata, anterior limb of the internal capsule, left anterior corona 
radiata, and left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus), smoking (body corpus 
callosum), diabetes (genu corpus callosum), and obesity (left inferior 
fronto-occipital fasciculus), each with one region.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension has a signature WMH pattern, whereas associations 
between other vascular risk factors and regional WMH volumes seem to be mainly 
explained by a global increase in WMH rather than region-specific effects.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral microhemorrhages (CMHs) and superficial siderosis (SS) 
are relatively common side effects of anti-amyloid immunotherapies, termed 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA-H). They are also observed in 
treatment-naïve older adults. This study explored relationships with modifiable 
and non-modifiable risk factors.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1414 cognitively unimpaired, 
treatment-naïve individuals aged 60 to 85 years from the Cognitive Health in 
Ageing Register: Investigational, Observational and Trial Studies in Dementia 
Research (CHARIOT): Prospective Readiness cOhort (PRO) SubStudy. Relationships 
between CMHs/SS and cardiovascular risk factors, amyloid beta (Aβ) load, 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status, educational attainment, and white matter 
hyperintensities were investigated using regression analyses and structural 
equation modeling.
RESULTS: CMHs were observed in 8.3% of participants and SS in 1.3%. Significant 
risk factors for CMHs included age and hypertension. Higher education attainment 
appeared to have a protective effect. Elevated amyloid is a risk factor, 
particularly when adjusting for APOE ε4 status in individuals aged 70 or 
younger.
DISCUSSION: Increasing age and hypertension are significant risk factors of 
CMHs. Higher educational attainment may offer a protective effect.
HIGHLIGHTS: Of the 1414 participants from the CHARIOT-PRO SubStudy (CPSS), CMHs 
were present in 118 (8.3%), and SS was present in 18 (1.3%). Age and 
hypertension were identified as significant risk factors for CMHs, and the 
latter had a stronger association with the presence of CMHs among female 
participants. Having a bachelor's degree or higher was found to be protective. 
Elevated brain amyloid burden, particularly when adjusted for APOE ε4 carrier 
status, was identified as a risk factor in individuals aged 70 years and below.

Disease heterogeneity and commonality pose significant challenges to precision 
medicine, as traditional approaches frequently focus on single disease entities 
and overlook shared mechanisms across conditions1. Inspired by pan-cancer2 and 
multi-organ research3, we introduce the concept of "pan-disease" to investigate 
the heterogeneity and shared etiology in brain, eye, and heart diseases. 
Leveraging individual-level data from 129,340 participants, as well as 
summary-level data from the MULTI consortium, we applied a weakly-supervised 
deep learning model (Surreal-GAN4,5) to multi-organ imaging, genetic, proteomic, 
and RNA-seq data, identifying 11 AI-derived biomarkers - called Multi-organ AI 
Endophenotypes (MAEs) - for the brain (Brain 1-6), eye (Eye 1-3), and heart 
(Heart 1-2), respectively. We found Brain 3 to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) progression and mortality, whereas Brain 5 was protective against 
AD progression. Crucially, in data from an anti-amyloid AD drug (solanezumab6), 
heterogeneity in cognitive decline trajectories was observed across treatment 
groups. At week 240, patients with lower brain 1-3 expression had slower 
cognitive decline, whereas patients with higher expression had faster cognitive 
decline. A multi-layer causal pathway pinpointed Brain 1 as a mediational 
endophenotype7 linking the FLRT2 protein to migraine, exemplifying novel 
therapeutic targets and pathways. Additionally, genes associated with Eye 1 and 
Eye 3 were enriched in cancer drug-related gene sets with causal links to 
specific cancer types and proteins. Finally, Heart 1 and Heart 2 had the highest 
mortality risk and unique medication history profiles, with Heart 1 showing 
favorable responses to antihypertensive medications and Heart 2 to digoxin 
treatment. The 11 MAEs provide novel AI dimensional representations for 
precision medicine and highlight the potential of AI-driven patient 
stratification for disease risk monitoring, clinical trials, and drug discovery.

INTRODUCTION: Chronological age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, the association of accelerated 
biological aging relative to chronological age with ADRD pathology is unclear.
METHODS: In a cohort of 2,366 cognitively unimpaired older women from the 
Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, we examined associations of five 
baseline measures of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) with 15-year changes in 
plasma ADRD biomarkers.
RESULTS: At baseline, higher AgeAccelPheno was associated with lower amyloid-β42 
to amyloid-β40 (Aβ42:Aβ40) ratio, and higher AgeAccelGrim2 was associated with 
elevated neurofilament light (NfL). Longitudinally, higher DunedinPACE - which 
measures the pace of biological aging - was associated with faster increases in 
phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), p-tau217, NfL, and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) over 15 years.
DISCUSSION: Accelerated biological aging, particularly as indicated by 
DunedinPACE, was associated with increasing levels of plasma ADRD biomarkers 
over time.

Specific Lipid Abnormalities Are Inherently Associated with Late-Onset 
Alzheimer's Disease.

Cohen BM, Koh E, Levental KR, Levental I, Sonntag KC.

INTRODUCTION: Lipid abnormalities have been observed in brain, CSF, and blood in 
association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). It is unknown which 
abnormalities are precursors to LOAD and which are concomitants of illness or 
its treatment. Inherent abnormalities can be identified in induced pluripotent 
stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural lines.
METHODS: iPSC lines of patients with LOAD or healthy individuals were 
differentiated to astrocytes. Lipidomics analyses were performed on whole cell 
and mitochondrial extracts.
RESULTS: Large reductions in cholesterol esters (CE) and imbalances in fatty 
acids (FA) were observed in LOAD-associated cells or their mitochondria. There 
were only modest differences in other lipid classes, including membrane 
structural lipids.
DISCUSSION: The findings identify abnormalities in CE and FA as likely 
precursors to LOAD. These differences implicate mechanisms contributing to 
disease pathogenesis. Further study may lead to early interventions to prevent 
or delay LOAD.

A major challenge in understanding Alzheimer's disease is linking changes that 
occur across different biological scales. For example, how do changes in 
individual neurons build into widespread network disruptions? To address this, 
we used flexible mesh electronics to record neuronal activity for six months in 
ThyTau22 mice, a model of tauopathy that accumulates mutant human tau with age. 
Electrophysiology was recorded simultaneously from the hippocampus and 
entorhinal cortex of awake, behaving mice. At all ages we observed neuron-level, 
tau-driven silencing including ages without detectable tangles or cell-death. We 
found an unexpected phenomenon: neurons silenced by tau spontaneously recover 
individual firing patterns, yet these neurons fail to regain normal network 
interactions. Thus, as the animals age, disrupted network-level activity 
emerges. Specifically, we observe a global decrease in excitatory interactions 
and a breakdown in gamma-band coherence, which is particularly disrupted between 
the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These observations reveal a temporal 
relationship between neuronal silencing and impaired network connectivity, which 
also contributes to a progressive disruption in the excitatory/inhibitory 
balance. This ultimately disconnects viable entorhinal-hippocampal connections, 
physiologically isolating the hippocampus. Importantly, this network dysfunction 
is not driven by neuron loss, but by the failure of neurons to re-establish 
proper network interactions after silencing. This reveals a previously 
unrecognized mechanism by which mutant tau can destabilize neural systems. 
Further, these experiments indicate that a therapeutic window may exist where 
neuronal function and network activity might still be restored prior to 
irreversible degeneration.

PURPOSE: Visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) accumulation causes systemic 
inflammation, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and senescent cell 
accumulation that are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visceral fat 
removal (VFR) improves metabolism and reduces proinflammatory cytokines. We 
hypothesized that VFR removal in AD mice would improve metabolism and cognition.
METHODS: Male and female APPNL-F mice underwent sham or vWAT surgical resection 
(epididymal and perirenal) at 4 (pre-symptomatic) and 16 (symptomatic) months of 
age to understand interventional and therapeutic effects, respectively. At 18 
months of age, glucose metabolism and novel object recognition (NOR) memory were 
assayed followed by assessment of body composition and tissue-specific markers 
of metabolism, cell senescence, inflammation, or amyloid accumulation.
RESULTS: Male and female APPNL-F mice showed distinct VFR responses. In 
pre-symptomatic males, increased vWAT lipolysis and hepatic lipogenesis led to 
ectopic liver lipid accumulation, with reduced adiponectin and leptin, elevated 
visfatin, and impaired glucose metabolism. Symptomatic males showed reduced vWAT 
lipogenesis, enhanced hepatic lipolysis, glycolysis, and glycogenesis, lowering 
liver lipids and improving insulin sensitivity. Only symptomatic males improved 
NOR, linked to elevated hippocampal learning and memory markers. Female vWAT 
reaccumulation was due to increased lipogenesis and lower lipolysis. 
Pre-symptomatic females had lower hepatic lipogenesis, while glycolysis and 
glycogenesis declined with disease progression. Hippocampal senescence and 
inflammation were elevated early in the disease that persisted symptomatically.
CONCLUSIONS: Sex-specific differences in glucose and lipid metabolism and lipid 
accumulation underlie the divergent responses to VFR in APPNL-F mice, with 
symptomatic males showing the only beneficial outcomes in metabolism and 
cognition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disease characterized by 
various biological signatures, including synaptic dysfunction, β-amyloid 
plaques, hyperphosphorylated Tau, cofilin-actin rods, and Hirano bodies, all of 
which are linked to the actin cytoskeleton and its regulators. Additionally, the 
presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the brains of AD patients has 
long been suggested as a contributing factor for AD. However, mechanisms by 
which HSV-1 accelerates AD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here we report 
that HSV-1 infection induces hyperphosphorylation of cofilin in the brains of 
5×FAD mice. Cofilin is an actin depolymerizing factor, and its S3 
phosphorylation inactivates cofilin's activity to depolymerize actin filaments. 
These findings facilitate the understanding of impacts of HSV-1 infection on the 
development of Alzheimer's disease and have implications in AD therapeutics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 6.9 million people over the age of 65 in the US 
and is expected to double by 2060. While FDA approved immunotherapies slow 
cognitive decline in some individuals with AD, they do not improve cognition, 
are costly, and have significant side-effects. Therefore, new targets, 
approaches, and treatments for AD are a necessity. There are no FDA approved 
therapies for AD that target the brain's lymphatic system. It is well 
established that the toxic protein, amyloid-beta (Aβ), accumulates in the AD 
brain. Recent studies have shown that Aβ is cleared via interstitial fluid and 
cerebrospinal fluid through a pathway involving the glymphatic system-meningeal 
lymphatic vessels-leading to deep and superficial cervical lymphatic vessels and 
nodes. Therefore, any blockage along this route can cause inefficient drainage 
and result in pathological buildup of Aβ, which can lead to AD. Here, we propose 
a new approach to treating AD by manual lymph drainage (MLD), which is a light 
skin massage traditionally used to reduce fluid accumulation in lymphedema. This 
therapy has also been demonstrated to be safe in individuals with AD, but its 
effects on cognition and biomarkers of AD has never been investigated. In this 
study we demonstrate that repeated MLD of the head and neck, including the 
superficial cervical lymphatic vessels (scLVs), improves cognitive function in 
AD as measured in both the Y-maze and nest-building tests. We also show that 
this coincides with a reduction in plasma levels of neurofilament light chain 
(NfL), a non-specific biomarker for neuronal cell death and axonal damage. MLD 
was also shown to reduce Aβ in the hippocampus of these mice. Combined, this 
data provides compelling proof-of-principle evidence for the potential of MLD as 
a standalone or adjunct therapy in the treatment of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical phase lasting 
more than a decade before the onset of its clinical phase of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or dementia. Recent advances in psychedelic research underscore 
numerous neuroplastogenic and anti-inflammatory alterations induced by these 
compounds, making them promising therapeutic candidates for AD. In this mini 
review, we will briefly summarize the existing literature using human cerebral 
organoids to study the molecular and metabolic changes caused by various 
psychedelic compounds, focusing on their potential therapeutic applications for 
AD.

BACKGOUND: Ligand-activated Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs) regulate gene networks 
essential for neural development, neuroinflammation, and metabolism. 
Understanding how RXR activation influences chromatin architecture and gene 
expression may reveal therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: We used Bexarotene-treated APP/PS1ΔE9 mice to study RXR-mediated 
regulatory mechanisms. To investigate epigenomic and transcriptional effects, we 
integrated single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) with single-cell RNA-seq 
(scRNA-seq) and validated differentially accessible chromatin peaks using RXR 
ChIP-seq. Transcription factor (TF) footprinting analysis were performed to map 
regulatory networks activated by ligand-bound RXR.
RESULTS: Our integrated analyses revealed a multilayered transcriptional cascade 
initiated by a single linear RXR signaling event. We identified RXR-centered 
regulatory circuits involving heterodimer activation, subsequent upregulation of 
multiple downstream TFs, and induction of metabolic pathways relevant to neural 
function. The results of a detailed analysis of TF regulatory networks in 
neuronal systems suggests that Bexarotene doesn't dismantle the fundamental 
regulatory scaffold in neurons but rather modulates RXR regulatory role through 
existing TF networks.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that combining scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and 
ChIP-seq enables a comprehensive analysis of RXR-mediated transcriptional 
regulation. RXR activation orchestrates complex gene networks that may help 
restore brain homeostasis in the context of amyloid pathology, 
neuroinflammation, and neuronal injury.

Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accumulation of senile plaques composed of 
neurotoxic amyloid β (Aβ) is known to be one of the causes. Shati/Nat8l, a gene 
related to neuropsychiatric disorders, encodes an enzyme that biosynthesizes 
N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) from aspartate and acetyl CoA. Studies on AD patients 
and model mice show that NAA and Shati/Nat8l are associated with AD pathology. 
We previously demonstrated that hippocampal overexpression of Shati/Nat8l in 
5xFAD mice, an AD model, improved cognitive suppress without altering the number 
or size of Aβ plaques. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the 
neuroprotective effects of Shati/Nat8l on Aβ neurotoxicity, we constructed a 
vector containing the full-length Shati/Nat8l sequence and transfected it into 
Neuro-2a cells to produce a stably Shati/Nat8l-overexpressing cell line 
(N2A-Shati). N2A-Shati cells expressed threefold higher Shati/Nat8l mRNA levels 
compared with a control cell line (N2A-Control). Treatment with Aβ for 48 h 
reduced the viability of N2A-Shati and N2A-Control cells at concentrations 
≧ 0.03 μM compared to their own vehicle. Exposure to 0.03 μM Aβ for 24 h did not 
induce any detectable changes in mitochondrial mass or mitochondrial membrane 
potential in either N2A-Control or N2A-Shati cells. However, N2A-Shati cells 
demonstrated reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (Pdk1) mRNA expression and 
enhanced nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1) and mitochondrial transcription 
factor A (Tfam) mRNA expression levels. These results suggest that, although 
Shati/Nat8l does not significantly affect cell viability, mitochondrial mass, or 
membrane potential, it could modulate specific intracellular pathways.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), involving amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, has potential 
therapeutic modulators in polyoxometalates (POMs) like [PMo12O40]3-. To clarify 
their inhibitory mechanisms, a multiscale computational strategy integrating 
active-learning Bayesian Optimization (BO) and density functional theory (DFT) 
is employed to explore low-energy configurations of isolated amino acids, 
[PMo12O40]3 --amino acid complexes, and [PMo12O40]3 --peptide systems. Hydrogen 
bonding and Coulombic repulsion dominate adsorption stability. Crucially, oxygen 
atoms in the [PMo12O40]3 - cluster form multiple weak interactions (e.g., van 
der Waals, hydrophobic) with alkyl side-chain hydrogens in Aβ peptides. The 
synergistic effect of these weak interactions induces robust binding between the 
POM and peptide chains, stabilizing a tightly bound complex that sterically 
hinders Aβ self-assembly. Notably, simulations predict that the cluster 
preferentially targets hydrophobic amino acids with alkyl chains (valine, 
lysine, leucine, isoleucine) located in Aβ regions critical for 
aggregation-specifically, namely Aβ12, Aβ16-18, Aβ24, Aβ28, Aβ31-32, Aβ34-36, 
and Aβ39-41. These insights highlight the role of multivalent weak interactions 
in POM-mediated inhibition and identify key interfacial residues for therapeutic 
targeting.

BackgroundCognitive decline and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
progresses over time. Early diagnosis is crucial for initiating treatment that 
can slow progression and preserve daily functioning. However, challenges such as 
overfitting in prediction models, underutilized biomarker features, and noisy 
imaging data hinder the accuracy of current detection methods.ObjectiveThis 
study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework aimed at improving the 
identification of AD stages while addressing the limitations of existing 
diagnostic techniques.MethodsStructural MRI scans are employed as the primary 
diagnostic tool. To enhance image quality, contrast-limited adaptive histogram 
equalization and wavelet soft thresholding are applied for noise reduction. 
Biomarker segmentation focuses on ventricular and hippocampal abnormalities, 
optimized using a firefly algorithm. Dimensionality reduction is performed via 
Linear Discriminant Analysis to minimize overfitting. Finally, a Deep Belief 
Network optimized using the Cuckoo Search algorithm is employed for 
classification and feature learning.ResultsThe proposed framework demonstrates 
improved performance over existing methods, achieving a 0.66% increase in 
accuracy and a 0.0345% decrease in error rate for AD stage 
detection.ConclusionsThis deep learning strategy shows promise as an effective 
tool for early and accurate AD stage identification. Enhanced segmentation, 
dimensionality reduction, and classification contribute to its improved 
performance, offering a meaningful advancement in AD diagnostics.

BACKGROUND: Slow-wave sleep has been proposed to facilitate the removal of 
proteins, implicated in neurodegeneration, from the brain. While mechanistic 
evidence from animal models is accumulating, direct human data on how slow-wave 
sleep shapes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteostasis remain limited, constraining 
our understanding of physiological resilience to neurodegenerative disease.
METHODS: Twelve healthy adults (aged 20–40 years) underwent CSF sampling 
following three controlled sleep conditions in a randomized crossover design; 
(1) one night of sleep followed by afternoon CSF sampling, (2) one night of 
sleep followed by morning CSF sampling, and (3) one night of total sleep 
deprivation followed by morning CSF sampling. Sleep and wakefulness were 
verified using polysomnography and actigraphy, with > 4-week washout periods 
between conditions. Measured CSF biomarkers included Alzheimer’s disease-related 
proteins: beta-amyloid isoforms (Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42), total tau, tau 
phosphorylated at amino acid 181 (p-tau), glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), and neurofilament light chain, as well as orexin, albumin (also measured 
in serum), and osmolality. Differences between conditions were assessed using 
Friedman tests with Dunn’s post hoc correction.
RESULTS: CSF levels of Aβ and tau tended to be consistently lower after sleep 
compared with both afternoon sampling and post-sleep deprivation. Concurrently, 
CSF albumin levels increased after sleep, while neurofilament light and GFAP 
remained unchanged. Orexin levels rose markedly during sleep deprivation but 
showed no circadian variation and did not track with biomarker levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a model in which slow-wave sleep selectively 
reduces CSF concentrations of Aβ and tau, potentially through enhanced solute 
mobility and receptor-mediated clearance. Unchanged levels of NfL and GFAP argue 
against bulk clearance. Orexin may primarily function to oppose sleep pressure 
rather than directly regulate proteostasis. These hypotheses merit direct 
testing to inform strategies for delaying pathological protein accumulation in 
neurodegenerative disease.

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is an early pathological hallmark of 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), occurring prior to amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. A key 
factor contributing to BBB damage in AD is the loss of endothelial expression of 
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). Endothelial LRP1 is 
crucial for maintaining BBB integrity and facilitating the transcytosis of Aβ 
across the BBB for peripheral clearance. However, LRP1 is also expressed in 
other neural cell types, such as neurons, where it paradoxically promotes Aβ 
generation and tau propagation. These dual roles of LRP1 for different cell 
types present a challenge for developing effective AD therapy targeting LRP1. 
Simvastatin (SIM), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to induce 
compensatory upregulation of LRP1 expression. To harness this potential, we 
designed SIM-loaded Angiopep-2-anchored nanoparticles (S@A-NPs) that can be 
effectively internalized by endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that 
intravenous (IV) injection with S@A-NPs upregulates endothelial LRP1 expression 
level, repairs BBB damage, attenuates Aβ accumulation, mitigates 
neurodegeneration, and ultimately preserves cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. 
These results highlight the potential of endothelial delivery of SIM via 
nanoparticles to attenuate AD pathogenesis. Our study proposes a novel 
therapeutic strategy for AD by leveraging nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery.

Anti-amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) immunotherapy was developed to reduce amyloid plaque 
pathology and slow cognitive decline during progression of Alzheimer's disease. 
Efficient amyloid clearance has been proven in clinical trials testing anti-Aβ 
antibodies, by their impact on cognitive endpoints correlating with the extent 
of amyloid removal. However, treatment is associated with adverse side effects, 
such as oedema and haemorrhages, which are potentially linked to the induced 
immune response. To improve the safety profile of these molecules, it is 
imperative to understand the consequences of anti-Aβ antibody treatment on 
immune cell function. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term chronic 
anti-Aβ treatment on amyloid plaque pathology and microglial response in the 
APP-SAA triple knock-in mouse model with an intervention paradigm early during 
amyloidogenesis. Long-term treatment with anti-Aβ results in a robust and 
dose-dependent lowering of amyloid plaque pathology, with a higher efficiency 
for reducing diffuse over dense-core plaque deposition. Analysis of the CSF 
proteome indicates a reduction of markers for neurodegeneration including Tau 
and α-Synuclein, as well as immune-cell-related proteins. Bulk RNA-seq revealed 
a dose-dependent attenuation of disease-associated microglial (DAM) and 
glycolytic gene expression, which is supported by a parallel decrease of glucose 
uptake and protein levels of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 
(Trem2) protein, a major immune receptor involved in DAM activation of 
microglia. In contrast, DAM activation around residual plaques remains high, 
regardless of treatment dose. In addition, microglia surrounding residual 
plaques display a dose-dependent increase in microglial clustering and a 
selective increase in antigen-presenting and immune signalling proteins. These 
findings demonstrate that chronic early intervention by an anti-amyloid 
immunotherapy leads to a dose-dependent decrease in plaque formation, which is 
associated with lower brain-wide microglial DAM activation and 
neurodegeneration. Microglia at residual plaques still display a combined DAM 
and antigen-presenting phenotype that suggests a continued treatment response.

BACKGROUND: Hyperexcitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons contributes 
to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tropisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonist and partial α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) agonist, 
has shown neuroprotective effects, but its impact on hippocampal neuronal 
excitability remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effects of tropisetron on CA1 
pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking interneurons in wild-type (WT) and hAPP-J20 
AD model mice, a transgenic model for early-onset AD.
METHODS: Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on hippocampal slices 
from 4-month-old WT and hAPP-J20 mice. Neuronal firing and action potential 
characteristics, including resting membrane potential (RMP), input resistance, 
threshold, amplitude and half-width were assessed with and without tropisetron.
RESULTS: Pyramidal neurons in hAPP-J20 mice exhibited hyperexcitability, 
characterized by enhanced spike numbers, increased input resistance, and 
decreased RMP. Tropisetron significantly decreased their excitability 
accompanied by lowering action potential threshold and reducing amplitude. In 
contrast, tropisetron induced complex effects on fast-spiking interneurons, 
including a reduction in spike numbers at higher current steps, a lower action 
potential threshold, and a decrease in spike amplitude.
CONCLUSION: Tropisetron modulates the firing activity of pyramidal and 
fast-spiking hippocampal CA1 neurons in hAPP-J20 mice, suggesting its potential 
to restore network balance and mitigate AD-related dysfunctions. These findings 
support further investigation into tropisetron as a therapeutic agent for AD.

The NF-κB signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, particularly through its role in the 
regulation neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, and 
apoptosis. Emerging evidence suggests that acupuncture modulates the NF-κB 
pathway, thus offering therapeutic potential by mitigating neuroinflammation, 
reducing oxidative stress, and protecting mitochondrial function. Specifically, 
acupuncture inhibits NF-κB activation, downregulates pro-inflammatory mediators 
like TNF-α and IL-6, and mitigates neurotoxicity and apoptosis. These effects 
are substantiated in animal models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, with 
preliminary evidence in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis models. However, current 
studies largely rely on preclinical models with limited acupoint selection, 
short observation periods, and a lack of standardized protocols, posing 
challenges for translation to clinical settings. Future research should 
prioritize well-designed clinical trials, expand acupoint combinations, and 
explore synergistic effects with conventional therapies, aiming to maximize 
acupuncture's therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative diseases.

METHODS: A literature search in February 2021, updated in July 2023, using 
MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ALOIS, and CINAHL identified 49 studies involving 
2,795 participants. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
quasi-RCTs. Intervention components included reminiscence therapy, activities of 
daily living, physical exercises, cognitive exercises, music and art therapy, 
reality orientation, and multisensory stimulation.
RESULTS: Variations were observed in procedures, materials, delivery modes, and 
durations, with a low overall risk of bias. Notably, no studies reported 
barriers to delivery, and only one included patient input.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the need for improved intervention design and 
methodologies, including digital adaptations and individualization of 
group-based components. Future research should employ established frameworks to 
describe interventions and prioritize patient and public involvement throughout 
the research process.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disorder closely associated with impaired 
autophagy. Ginkgolide A (GA), a principal bioactive constituent of Ginkgo 
biloba, has garnered attention for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and 
autophagy-modulating properties.
MAIN TEXT: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of GA, we administered oral GA 
(20 mg/kg/day) for four weeks to 5xFAD transgenic mice. GA treatment 
significantly reduced soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the 
cortex and hippocampus, and markedly decreased Aβ plaque deposition. Cognitive 
performance was improved, as evidenced by increased spontaneous alternation in 
the Y-maze test. GA enhanced synaptic plasticity, indicated by increased 
expression of the synaptic markers synaptophysin 11 (SP11) and postsynaptic 
density 95 (PSD95). At the molecular level, GA activated autophagy by modulating 
PI3K-Akt signaling, relieving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and enhancing 
energy stress responses, ultimately leading to mTOR pathway suppression.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that GA is a promising multifunctional 
therapeutic candidate for AD. Its ability to regulate autophagy and related 
signaling pathways provides new insights into disease mitigation and cognitive 
improvement.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The 
primary pathological features of AD are the abnormal deposition of extracellular 
β-amyloid (Aβ) protein and hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein 
tau. Excessive Aβ aggregation triggers neuroinflammation. Oleanolic acid (OA) 
has significant neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we 
designed and synthesized 35 OA derivatives for the treatment of AD, targeting Aβ 
and hyperphosphorylated tau. The results showed that compound B1, an OA 
derivative with a tetrazole, had the strongest activity against Aβ25-35-induced 
cytotoxicity (EC50 = 1.93 ± 0.76 μM), approximately 14.75-fold more potent than 
OA and could penetrate the BBB. Intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ25-35 to 
establish an AD-like mouse model, the histopathological results showed that B1 
relieved nerve damage, and Morris water maze results showed that B1 improved 
learning and memory. Mechanistically, B1 reversed the hyperphosphorylation of 
tau, significantly inhibited the expression of certain immune-related cytotoxic 
factors, suppressed the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, and significantly 
inhibited the expression of RAGE and the apoptosis factors Bax/Bcl-2, both in 
vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, B1 regulates neuroinflammatory mediators in 
response to Aβ and reverses the hyperphosphorylation of tau, and is a promising 
multifunctional compound for treating AD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Identifying β-amyloid (Aβ) positivity is crucial for 
selecting candidates for Aβ-targeted therapies in early-stage Alzheimer disease 
(AD). While Aβ PET is accurate, its high cost limits routine use. Plasma 
p-tau217 testing offers a less invasive option but also incurs additional costs. 
Structural brain MRI, routinely used in cognitive assessments, can identify 
features predictive of Aβ positivity without extra expense. We evaluated a 
2-stage workflow integrating MRI-based features and plasma p-tau217 to 
efficiently predict Aβ PET positivity in early-stage AD.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included participants with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or early Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) from the 
Korea-Registries to Overcome Dementia and Accelerate Dementia Research (K-ROAD; 
Korea) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; US) cohorts. 
Eligible participants had a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5, along with 
MRI, plasma p-tau217, and Aβ PET data. A random forest classifier predicting Aβ 
PET positivity was developed using MRI-based brain atrophy patterns and APOE ε4 
status. Participants were stratified into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and 
high-risk groups; plasma p-tau217 testing was performed only in 
intermediate-risk individuals. Outcomes included positive predictive value 
(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy.
RESULTS: A total of 807 K-ROAD participants (median age 72.0 years, 58.7% 
female) and 230 ADNI participants (median age 70.9 years, 49.1% female) were 
analyzed. Using a 95% sensitivity/specificity strategy, the low-risk group 
demonstrated NPVs of 94.7% (91.7%-97.7%, K-ROAD) and 99.0% (97.0%-100.0%, ADNI). 
The high-risk group showed PPVs of 97.6% (95.9%-99.3%, K-ROAD) and 98.8% 
(96.5%-100.0%, ADNI). Intermediate-risk groups comprised 33.3% (K-ROAD) and 
20.9% (ADNI) of participants. Plasma p-tau217 testing in intermediate-risk 
groups yielded PPVs of 92.5% (88.7%-96.3%, K-ROAD) and 90.0% (79.0%-100.0%, 
ADNI) and NPVs of 83.1% (75.0%-91.2%, K-ROAD) and 83.3% (66.1%-100.0%, ADNI). 
The overall workflow accuracy was 94.2% (92.6%-95.8%, K-ROAD) and 96.5% 
(94.1%-98.9%, ADNI).
DISCUSSION: The 2-stage diagnostic workflow integrating MRI-based risk 
stratification and plasma p-tau217 testing accurately identified individuals 
with Aβ PET positivity in early-stage AD, substantially reducing the need for 
additional biomarker testing. However, the generalizability may be limited by 
modest incremental improvement over baseline models and limited racial and 
ethnic diversity.

BACKGROUND: Familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD) is a hereditary disease that 
develops at an unusually early age. The deposition of toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) is 
a hallmark of fAD. Despite their genetic origin and increasing prevalence, no 
effective drugs currently exist. THICAPA, a novel compound containing a 
tetrahydroisoquinoline group of amines, is naturally found in the brain and food 
and has diverse medicinal properties. However, its potential role in modulating 
amyloidogenesis in patients with fAD has not yet been explored.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of THICAPA on the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP) processing pathway in fibroblasts derived from patients 
with fAD. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay revealed no significant THICAPA 
cytotoxicity in fAD (AG06840) or healthy fibroblast cell lines (GM05879). Aβ 
scavenging assay revealed that 50 µM THICAPA potentially scavenged aged Aβ42 
oligomers in the healthy fibroblast line. Gene and protein expression analyses 
revealed reduced APP expression and mature/immature APP expression ratio, BACE1 
and presenilin 1 downregulation, and ADAM10 upregulation. Protein quantification 
revealed a significant reduction in C-terminal fragment beta, soluble APP 
(sAPP)β, and Aβ42/40 ratio in the amyloidogenic pathway and elevated sAPPα in 
the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Moreover, reactive oxygen species detection 
indicated that THICAPA reduced ROS production in fibroblasts from patients with 
fAD by 41.63%, although its intrinsic antioxidant properties were modest.
CONCLUSIONS: THICAPA attenuates amyloidogenesis and upregulates the 
non-amyloidogenic pathway while alleviating ROS production. These findings 
suggest that THICAPA is a potential therapeutic candidate for treating fAD.

Cognitive impairment has gradually become a serious social problem that 
endangers the normal life of elderly individuals. Traditional cognitive 
rehabilitation training (TCRT) is limited by family economic and medical 
insurance policies, making it difficult to sustain long-term rehabilitation 
training for patients with cognitive impairments. Leisure activities, as simple, 
efficient, and convenient intervention therapies, have been used for the 
rehabilitation of patients with cognitive impairment, but specific effects have 
not been reported. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluated 
the efficacy of leisure activity intervention versus TCRT control on cognitive 
function in patients with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. As of 
December 10, 2024, literature searches were conducted on PubMed, Embase, the 
Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and related databases. The PEDro scale was 
used to assess the risk of bias. A total of 20 randomized controlled trials (n = 
1126) used mahjong, poker, VR, or other games. The results revealed that leisure 
activity intervention improved overall cognitive function (MOCA, P = 0.012; 
MMSE, P = 0.013), memory function (DSB, P < 0.0001; DSF, P = 0.015), and quality 
of life (ADL, P < 0001). In summary, leisure activities can serve as a 
complementary and alternative therapy to traditional cognitive rehabilitation 
training to improve some cognitive domains of patients with cognitive 
impairments (PROSPERO registration: CRD42025639157).

INTRODUCTION: Assessment of short-term intra- and inter-individual variability 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers is essential for clinically 
relevant interpretation of biomarker levels. We hypothesized that the 
variability of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) could be 
reduced by combining it with a tau marker, plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau), as 
the p-tau217/BD-tau ratio.
METHODS: Three consecutive blood samples were collected from memory clinic 
patients within 36 days. Patients were dichotomized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
amyloidosis (Aβ+ = 29, Aβ- = 18). We compared intra- and inter-individual 
variability (coefficient of variation [CV]) in the plasma p-tau217/BD-tau ratio 
with p-tau217 alone and tested if kidney function, glycated hemoglobin, and body 
mass index (BMI) affected the variability. Finally, we compared the 
p-tau217/BD-tau ratio with CSF p-tau217.
RESULTS: We found that for Aβ+ individuals, the intra-individual variability of 
the plasma p-tau217/BD-tau ratio (CV 7.1% [95% confidence interval {CI} 
5.6;8.4]) was lower than for p-tau217 alone (CV 9.4% [95% CI 7.4;11.5]). At the 
group level, the variability in the p-tau217/BD-tau ratio was reduced in both 
Aβ+ (CV 15.1% [95% CI 11.7;18.7]) and Aβ- (CV 18.4% [95% CI 13.0;23.8]) 
individuals compared to p-tau217 alone (Aβ+ CV 19.1 [15.0;23.4], Aβ- 27.1 
[18.4;36.0]). Adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin 
A1C, and BMI further reduced the inter-individual variability of p-tau217/BD-tau 
in the Aβ+ group. CSF p-tau217 showed higher correlation with plasma 
p-tau217/BD-tau (rho = 0.53, p = 0.0005) than with p-tau217 alone (rho = 0.37, p 
= 0.02).
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that using the ratio of plasma p-tau217 to 
plasma BD-tau and accounting for the influence of peripheral confounders 
improves biomarker stability, which is important for the interpretation of 
longitudinal biomarker changes and to prevent misclassification.
HIGHLIGHTS: The plasma p-tau217/BD-tau ratio lowered short-term intra- and, 
especially, inter-individual variability compared to the variability in plasma 
p-tau217 alone.Plasma BD-tau did not correlate with eGFR, HbA1c, or BMI, while 
plasma p-tau217 was significantly negatively associated with BMI.Adjusting for 
eGFR, HbA1c, and BMI further reduced the inter-individual variability of 
p-tau217/BD-tau.Additionally, CSF p-tau217 correlated better with plasma 
p-tau217/BD-tau than with p-tau217 alone.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects women more frequently and more severely than 
men, but the biological mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain 
poorly understood. This review integrates recent findings from neuroscience, 
immunology, endocrinology, and genetics to explore how sex steroid hormones, 
particularly estrogen, shape neuroimmune responses and influence AD risk. We 
highlight the pivotal roles of microglia and astrocytes, whose inflammatory and 
neuroprotective actions are modulated by hormonal fluctuations across the female 
lifespan, including pregnancy, menopause, and menopausal hormone replacement 
therapy. Key genetic risk factors, such as apolipoprotein E ε4, show 
sex-specific effects on glial activation, tau pathology, and cognitive decline. 
Furthermore, life-stage transitions, especially menopause, intersect with 
changes in brain metabolism, immune signaling, and epigenetic regulation, 
increasing susceptibility to neurodegeneration in women. We propose a framework 
for sex-aware, personalized approaches to AD prevention and treatment. By 
integrating hormone-immune interactions with genetic and glial biology, this 
review emphasizes the critical need for sex-specific models in AD research.
HIGHLIGHTS: Women develop greater tauopathy, with more cognitive and clinical 
consequences in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Glial activation is adapted by 
estrogens to shape vulnerability or resilience to AD.Sex differences in innate 
and adaptive immunity could contribute to AD progression.Effects of menopausal 
hormone therapy on immunity in AD remain understudied.Future studies to explore 
sex differences in immune function during AD are needed.

Parkinson disease (PD) is the second largest and most common neurodegenerative 
disease globally, following Alzheimer disease. Its pathological features include 
the deformation and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars 
compacta of the midbrain, as well as the aggregation of α-synuclein in the form 
of Lewy bodies. This leads to motor symptoms such as resting tremors, muscle 
rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms 
including cognitive, emotional, and sleep disorders. Currently, PD is mainly 
treated by medication and surgery. Medication, though widely used, has limited 
efficacy and causes adverse reactions. With the intensification of global aging 
and the annual increase in the incidence of PD, the limitations of existing 
treatment approaches have become increasingly prominent, and there is an urgent 
need to explore safer and more effective treatment strategies. Numerous clinical 
studies have demonstrated that exercise rehabilitation training can not only 
effectively ameliorate the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD patients, but also 
promote the generation of neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, and hormones, 
and regulate the dopaminergic system. Therefore, an in-depth exploration of the 
mechanisms and effects of different exercise rehabilitation training methods in 
the treatment of PD holds great significance for refining the comprehensive 
treatment plan for PD and enhancing the quality of life of patients. This 
article will conduct a comprehensive review of the mechanisms and effects of 
various exercise rehabilitation training methods in treating PD.

OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of 
healthcare professionals in Somaliland towards dementia.
METHODS: Between June and July 2023, we administered an adapted online survey 
consisting of 30 Alzheimer's disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) true or false 
statements and 10 Dementia Care Attitude Scale (DCAS) Likert-scale items. The 
reliability of the Likert-scale DCAS items was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. 
The distribution of responses to DCAS statements was examined using a binomial 
test, and the relationship between knowledge or attitude and sample 
characteristics was assessed using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact 
test.
RESULTS: The overall validity (Cronbach's alpha) for DCAS statements (0.88) was 
greater than 0.80, indicating good level of internal consistency. Out of 107 
healthcare workers who completed the survey, 53.3% had unfavourable attitude 
towards dementia care, and 49.5% had a moderate-to-high knowledge level.
CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot survey revealed a lack of knowledge and attitudes about 
dementia among health professionals and urges high quality surveys to validate 
the results.

Understanding and treating inflammation has proven a formidable challenge. The 
initiator and central motor of inflammation, the protein NLRP3, is an innate 
immune sentinel and nonspecific sensor of cellular perturbation. A wide array of 
inflammatory triggers prompts the formation of an NLRP3 'inflammasome' complex, 
leading to inflammatory interleukin-1 family cytokine release and pyroptotic 
cell death. Since gain-of-function mutations in NLRP3 were demonstrated to cause 
a rare autoinflammatory disease termed cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, 
NLRP3 has emerged as key mediator of inflammation in mouse models for many 
common diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and gout. But 
even though small-molecule NLRP3 modulators have entered clinical development, 
many aspects of NLRP3 activation and regulation in humans remain relatively 
unclear. This Review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms that drive NLRP3 inflammasome activation and regulation, and 
discusses emerging targeting strategies. Understanding these processes can guide 
precision medicine approaches aimed at mitigating NLRP3-driven pathologies.

Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by pathological tau 
protein inclusions and dementia. Tauopathy mouse models with MAPT mutations 
replicate tau-related pathologies and are widely used for therapeutic research. 
This scoping review examines 409 treatment evaluations in MAPT mouse models. We 
identify trends in therapeutic strategies and frequently used mouse models, 
treatment routes, and endpoints. We also document treatment effects and when 
treatment is initiated relative to tau pathology emergence. Many treatments 
produced positive effects in multiple MAPT mouse models across many endpoints 
but showed limited success in clinical trials. Potential barriers to 
mouse-to-human translation include differences between mouse and human studies 
in the timing of treatment initiation relative to tau pathology onset, 
predominant testing of a limited number of endpoints, lack of translatable 
treatment response biomarkers, and the limited ability of individual mouse 
models to represent the diversity of tauopathies. Addressing these obstacles 
could improve mouse-to-human translation for tauopathy therapeutics. HIGHLIGHTS: 
Two decades of therapeutic research in tauopathy mouse models were reviewed. 
Treatments often began before or at tau pathology onset in tauopathy mouse 
models. Key endpoints (e.g., cognition and synaptic degeneration) were 
underassessed. Well-characterized preclinical treatments often had limited 
success in humans. Single-sex mouse studies and a lack of biomarkers hinder 
clinical translation.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and the Lewy body diseases (LBDs) are caused by 
α-synuclein misfolding into distinct conformations, or strains, with unique 
biological properties. MSA patient samples readily transmit disease following 
intracranial (i.c.) inoculation into humanized mice, whereas LBD samples 
typically do not. Unexpectedly, we identified one LBD patient sample that, 
following i.c. inoculation, transmitted neurological disease to four out of six 
mice over an extended incubation period. In light of these unexpected results, 
we sought to identify the α-synuclein strain responsible for disease onset. 
Using immunohistochemistry, we identified both Lewy bodies and oligodendroglial 
inclusions with a glial cytoplasmic inclusion-like appearance in the substantia 
nigra of the patient sample. To determine if these glial inclusions were due to 
the presence of low titer MSA α-synuclein in the sample, we performed a 
secondary passage of two terminal mouse brains from the primary passage and 
found that the humanized mice developed disease with a shortened incubation 
period. Unexpectedly, using our panel of mutant α-syn140–YFP cells to analyze 
the primary and secondary passage samples showed that the strain isolated in the 
in vivo studies has unique biological properties compared to the MSA and LBD 
strains. These data suggest that the oligodendroglial pathology in the LBD 
patient sample was not caused by MSA co-pathology, and provide evidence for the 
isolation of a novel distinct α-synuclein strain.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 
Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) collectively represent the majority of 
dementia cases worldwide. While these subtypes share clinical, genetic, and 
pathological features, their transcriptomic similarities and differences remain 
poorly understood.
METHODS: We applied single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to prefrontal 
cortex samples from individuals with non-cognitive impairment control (NCI), and 
dementia subtypes (AD, DLB, and PDD) to investigate cell type-specific gene 
expression patterns and pathways underlying pathological similarities and 
differences across dementia subtypes. SnRNA-seq findings were validated through 
RNAscope, immunohistochemistry, and additional biochemical analyses in human 
tissues and cellular models.
RESULTS: SnRNA-seq analysis revealed elevated microglial proportions across all 
dementia subtypes compared to NCI. Further analysis of cell type-specific 
transcriptomes identified overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between microglia and oligodendrocytes across all dementia subtypes. While AD 
showed molecular similarities to NCI, PDD and DLB were clustered more closely 
together, sharing a greater number of DEGs and related pathways, predominantly 
associated with microglia. Investigation of interactions between microglia and 
oligodendrocytes revealed a distinct microglial state in all dementia subtypes. 
MSR1, a gene encoding a scavenger receptor, was upregulated in microglia across 
all dementia subtypes, along with its associated gene HSPA1A in 
oligodendrocytes. RNAscope supported the potential interaction between microglia 
and oligodendrocytes, where these cells were in closer proximity to each other 
in human cortical tissues of PDD compared to NCI. MSR1 expression was 
significantly increased in cortical primary microglia from PD mice compared with 
non-transgenic (NTg) mice. Additionally, the expression of myelin-associated 
genes (MBP, MOBP, and PLP1) was significantly upregulated in PD microglia 
compared to NTg, supporting the presence of the distinct microglia. Furthermore, 
MSR1-positive microglia colocalised with MBP in cortical tissue of PDD patients, 
suggesting a functional role of MSR1 in myelin debris clearance. Overexpression 
of MSR1 in microglial cells enhanced their phagocytic activity toward myelin, 
and reciprocally, myelin treatment upregulated MSR1 protein levels, indicating 
enhanced MSR1-mediated myelin phagocytosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the cell type-specific 
role of microglial MSR1 in AD, DLB, and PDD, linking its increased phagocytic 
capacity to myelin defects as a common feature of neurodegenerative dementias.

BACKGROUND: Older adults living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have impaired 
executive functions and can therefore have greater difficulty following the 
instructions of assessment tests. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability and criterion validity of the 
adapted Five-Times Sit-to-Stand (5STS), 30-Second Sit-to-Stand (30STS) and 
Calf-Rise Senior (CRS) tests for the assessment of lower limb muscle strength in 
older adults living with AD.
METHODS: A methodological study was conducted. For the adaptation of the 5STS, 
30STS and CRS tests, standardized verbal commands were added during the 
execution to assist the older adults in beginning and ending the tests (5STS and 
30STS: "stand up" and "sit down"; CRS: "stand on your tip toes" and "now you can 
get down"). Reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC3,1), standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable 
change (MDC95). Criterion validity of the adapted tests was tested by the 
correlation with isokinetic measures of the knee and ankle using Spearman's 
correlation.
RESULTS: Forty-two older adults living with AD were included (Mild-AD: 22; 
Moderate-AD: 20). Intra- and inter-rater reliability were moderate (ICC3,1: 
5STS: 0.60, 0.50; 30STS: 0.55; CRS: 0.68, 0.65), with the exception of 
inter-rater reliability of the 30STS test which was low (ICC3,1: 0.32). 
Intra-rater SEM and MDC95 (SEM: 5STS: 3.59, 8.33; 30STS: 0.85, 1.97; CRS: 1.37, 
3.18) were lower compared to inter-rater values (MDC95: 5STS: 4.02, 9.32; 30STS: 
1.42, 3.29; CRS: 1.76, 4.08). The adapted tests correlated significantly with 
peak torque, average peak torque and total work of the knee (5STS: extensors and 
flexors [60°/s] [r: -0.33 to -0.46]; 30STS: flexors [180°/s] [r: 0.31 to 0.61]) 
and ankle (CRS: plantar flexors and dorsiflexors [total work] [30°/s] [r: 0.32 
to 0.37]).
CONCLUSION: The adapted 5STS, 30STS and CRS tests demonstrated moderate 
reliability and correlated with maximum lower limb muscle strength and endurance 
in older adults living with AD.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid toxicity induces ferroptosis play a crucial role in the 
pathological dysfunction of brains affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite 
this, brain probing implements for looking into the relationship between 
ferroptosis and ROS in the brains of AD victims are currently scarce. Herein, a 
HClO activated ESIPT fluorescent probe HCC-Br was engineered to investigate the 
complicated correlations between HClO and AD, achieving in vivo diagnosing and 
evaluating of AD progression.
RESULTS: With this probe, we could also utilize HCC-Br for the visualization and 
tracking of endogenous HClO production in live cells during Aβ42-induced 
ferroptosis. More crucially, our findings suggest that tannic acid (TA) shows 
promise as an effective neuroprotective agent to control MPO-mediated oxidative 
stress in this stimulated condition. The small molecular structure and suitable 
lipophilicity endowed HCC-Br with remarkable blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability, making it enormously applicable to the in vivo detection of HClO 
variations in AD brains.
SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: Overall, this study presents a versatile fluorescence 
tool that can help clarify the contributions of HClO production by MPO in the 
pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Furthermore, it holds tremendous prospects in 
exploring the function of HClO in ferroptosis-related pathogenesis and treatment 
of AD.

Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, and is 
considered to contribute to dementia in 60%-70% of individuals with dementia. In 
recent years, a series of amyloid β protein (Aβ)-targeting antibodies that act 
directly on Aβ aggregates in the brain, one of the factors which contributes to 
the onset of Alzheimer's disease, have been approved to suppress the clinical 
progression, and Alzheimer's disease treatment in Japan is changing. This review 
article focuses on one of these Aβ-targeting antibodies, donanemab, and 
summarizes its clinical study results. (Received November 1, 2024; Accepted May 
7, 2025; Published August 1, 2025).

Depression is closely associated with dementia and may serve as a risk factor, 
an early symptom, or a prodromal feature, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, 
the most common form of dementia. It can also emerge during disease progression, 
not only in Alzheimer's but in other dementias such as vascular dementia, Lewy 
body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Recognizing the timing and context 
of depressive symptoms is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management. While 
non-pharmacological interventions and psychosocial approaches are generally 
recommended as the first line of treatment, clinical practice often sees 
widespread use of antidepressants in this vulnerable population. However, such 
usage is not always supported by robust evidence, particularly given the 
heightened risk of side effects in older adults with cognitive decline. This 
narrative review seeks to critically examine the role of antidepressants in 
managing depression among patients with dementia. Rather than dismissing their 
use outright, we aim to provide a novel perspective on their application, 
emphasizing the importance of a thorough multidimensional geriatric assessment. 
The attempt is to help the clinicians in making more individualized, 
evidence-based decisions that balance the potential benefits and risks, ensuring 
that treatment is tailored to the unique needs of each patient.

Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the 
oxidative deamination of dopamine and other neurotransmitters, contributing to 
neurodegeneration via increased oxidative stress. Elevated MAO-B activity is 
implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
diseases. Although several MAO-B inhibitors are clinically available, their 
therapeutic utility is often limited by poor selectivity, off-target effects, 
and suboptimal pharmacokinetics. Here, we developed an integrated computational 
approach to identify novel, selective MAO-B inhibitors by repurposing 
FDA-approved drugs. Support vector machine (SVM) classification models were 
trained on curated MAO-B bioactivity data using four molecular fingerprints, 
with robust feature selection and cross-validation. The models achieved high 
predictive performance (AUC up to 0.9914, accuracy >96.93 %, MCC > 0.9179) and 
were used to screen FDA-approved drugs. For benchmarking, Random Forest, XGBoost 
and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were also evaluated using the same datasets and 
molecular fingerprints. Although all the three algorithms exhibited strong 
predictive performance (AUC > 0.85), the SVM model consistently outperformed 
them across all key metrics, underscoring its robustness and reliability for 
MAO-B inhibitor prediction. Top-ranked leads were subjected to molecular 
docking, MM-GBSA binding free energy analysis, and extended 200 ns molecular 
dynamics simulations using Amber v.24. Z1541760033 (Irinotecan hydrochloride) 
emerged as the most promising candidate, showing a docking score of 
-11.86 kcal/mol, strong hydrogen bonding with Gly55, Gln204 and Tyr186, π-π 
stacking with Tyr433, and a favorable MM-GBSA ΔG_total of -98.3 ± 0.19 kcal/mol. 
MD analysis confirmed stable conformational behavior and persistent active-site 
engagement. Additional candidates, including Z1546610486, also displayed 
favorable interaction profiles and dynamic stability. Leveraging chemically 
diverse training data and extended MD simulations, our pipeline prioritizes drug 
candidates with high predicted affinity and dynamic stability. This study 
highlights the power of combining machine learning classification with atomistic 
simulations for drug repurposing and provides a set of promising lead compounds 
for further experimental validation as MAO-B inhibitors targeting 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite the capability of anti-amyloid monoclonal 
antibodies to lower β-amyloid (Aβ) brain levels, there is thus far limited 
clinical efficacy on cognitive outcomes. Among individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) or mild-stage dementia, the cognitive impact of other brain 
pathologies may limit efficacy of anti-amyloid drugs. This study examined the 
burden and cognitive associations of mixed brain pathologies among autopsied 
persons who would have been considered as patients to undergo anti-amyloid 
treatment eligibility assessment.
METHODS: Eligibility was defined based on a Mini-Mental State Examination score 
≥20, a clinical diagnosis of MCI or mild-stage Alzheimer dementia, and a level 
of Aβ pathology at autopsy indicative of having a positive amyloid PET scan 
(Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score ≥moderate). 
The number and types of copathologies were examined. Mixed-effects models were 
used to examine the association of Aβ, tangles, limbic predominant age-related 
transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy neuropathologic 
changes (LATE-NC), infarcts, Lewy bodies (LBs), and vessel diseases, with the 
rate of cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Among 428 older autopsied persons (mean age at death = 91 years, 70% 
women) considered for anti-amyloid treatment eligibility assessment, 58% had MCI 
and 42% had mild-stage Alzheimer dementia. Although the majority (94%) had a 
pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC), only 
26% had ADNC without LATE-NC, LB, or infarcts. The majority (68%) had ADNC with 
≥1 copathology with ADNC + infarcts and ADNC + LATE-NC being equally common. In 
mixed-effects models, tangles and arteriolosclerosis were both associated with a 
faster rate of global cognitive decline. Separately, tangles and LATE-NC were 
associated with a faster decline in episodic memory, ADNC was associated with 
faster decline in semantic memory with Aβ being further associated with decline 
in working memory, and atherosclerosis was associated with a faster decline in 
perceptual speed. Infarcts and LBs were not associated with decline in global 
cognition or any cognitive domain.
DISCUSSION: Mixed pathologies are common among community-dwelling older persons 
considered for anti-amyloid treatment eligibility assessment. Beyond Aβ, 
tangles, LATE-NC, and vessel pathologies drive cognitive decline in this group 
of individuals, especially episodic memory decline. These findings suggest that, 
even among those eligible for anti-amyloid therapies, substantial cognitive 
decline may occur because of the presence of coexisting pathologies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges to healthcare systems 
across the globe. Early and accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for effective 
management and treatment. Recent advances in neuroimaging and genomics provide 
an opportunity for developing multi-modality-based AD diagnosis models using 
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, the data complexities cause 
challenges in developing interpretable AI-based AD identification models. In 
this study, the author built a comprehensive AD diagnostic model using magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and gene expression data. MobileNet V3 and EfficientNet 
B7 model was employed to extract AD features from gene expression data. The 
author introduced a hybrid TWIN-Performer-based feature extraction model to 
derive features from MRI. The attention-based feature fusion was used to fuse 
the crucial features. An ensemble learning-based classification model 
integrating CatBoost, XGBoost, and extremely randomized tree (ERT) was developed 
to identify cognitively normal (CN) and AD features. The proposed model was 
validated on diverse datasets. It achieved a superior performance on MRI and 
gene expression datasets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(AUROC) scores were consistently above 0.85, indicating excellent model 
performance. The use of Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values improved the 
model's interpretability, leading to earlier interventions and personalized 
treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Assessing fall risk, especially in individuals with neurological 
disorders, is essential to prevent hospitalization, hypomobility, and reduced 
functional independence. Wearable sensors are increasingly used in 
neurorehabilitation, as they enable unsupervised fall risk assessment by 
providing continuous monitoring during daily functional tasks, thereby offering 
a reflection of the individual's real-world fall risk.
OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed the literature on reliable biomechanical 
gait parameters detected with wearable sensors to assess fall risk in 
neurological disorders, focusing on patients with Parkinson disease, multiple 
sclerosis, stroke, or Alzheimer disease. In addition, we examined the latest 
advancements in wearable sensor technology, including best practices for device 
placement as well as data processing and analysis.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive systematic search for relevant 
peer-reviewed articles published up to April 18, 2025, using PubMed, Web of 
Science, Embase, and IEEE Xplore, which are the most used databases in the 
fields of health and bioengineering.
RESULTS: The 19 included studies involved 2630 patients with neurological 
disorders, including 226 (8.59%) with multiple sclerosis (n=7, 37% studies), 
2305 (87.64%) with Parkinson disease (n=8, 53% studies), 51 (1.94%) with stroke 
(n=3, 16% studies), and 48 (1.83%) with Alzheimer disease or cognitive 
impairment (n=1, 5% study).
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the role of wearable technologies in 
assessing fall risk in patients with neurological disorders. Although the 
included studies showed variation in methods and a focus on technology over 
clinical context, the lack of standardization reflects ongoing advancements, 
which may be seen as a strength.

Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) presents with a diverse spectrum of 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, often leading to diagnostic challenges and delays in 
treatment. Neuroglial biomarkers may improve AE diagnosis, disease monitoring, 
and prognostication. This review examines the diagnostic and prognostic value of 
fluid biomarkers in AE, focusing on markers of neuroaxonal damage, synaptic 
dysfunction, astroglial activation, and amyloid metabolism. A systematic search 
of PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases (from inception until November 26, 
2024) was performed. Of the 1,270 articles screened, 31 studies met the 
inclusion criteria. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis was 
the most frequently investigated subtype (70% of studies). Neurofilament light 
chain (NfL) was the most widely analyzed biomarker, with elevated levels in both 
cerebrospinal fluid and serum, aiding in the differentiation of AE from primary 
psychiatric disorders and in the early identification of checkpoint 
inhibitor-related neurotoxicity. NfL and total tau (t-Tau) were consistently 
higher in paraneoplastic than non-paraneoplastic AE. Despite some variability 
across studies, amyloid-beta (Aβ) 42 and Aβ40, as well as phosphorylated tau 
(p-Tau), were altered in AE compared to controls, although generally to a lesser 
extent than in Alzheimer's disease. Higher baseline NfL and YKL-40 correlated 
with disease severity, and NfL reductions post-immunotherapy were linked to 
treatment response. Despite consistent heterogeneities in sampling timing, these 
findings highlight the potential of neuroglial biomarkers as diagnostic and 
prognostic tools in AE. Future studies should explore longitudinal biomarker 
dynamics and refine their clinical applications.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive, and destructive 
neurodegenerative disorder that severely affects human memory, intelligence, and 
behavioral abilities. Jiao Tai Wan (JTW) is a classic formula composed of two 
traditional Chinese medicines, coptis chinensis (CC) and cinnamon (CIN), the 
ratio of CC and CIN is 10:1. JTW has the effects of promoting cognitive 
function, and improving learning and memory function. But the specific mechanism 
has not been systematically studied. We conducted Morris water maze and Y-maze 
behavioral tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), assay kit and ELISA, nissl's 
staining, and western blotting to verified the improvement of cognitive function 
of JTW on APP/PS1 mice. Through behavioral experiments, JTW can improved the 
learning and spatial exploration abilities of APP/PS1 mice. Nissl's staining and 
PCR detection of BDNF, NGF, and SYP showed that JTW can improved 
neurodegenerative lesions in APP/PS1 mice. By detecting the activities of A β 
1-40, A β 1-42, α - secretase, β - secretase, and γ - secretase, as well as 
cholinergic labeling enzymes of Ach, AchE, and ChAT activities showed that JTW 
improved cerebral amyloidosis and cholinergic nervous system in APP/PS1 model 
mice. The detection of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress indicators 
revealed that JTW can inhibited the activity of inflammatory factors and 
oxidative stress. Western Blotting was used to detect the Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathway, 
and the result showed that JTW can regulate the Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathway to 
improving cognitive function of APP/PS1 mice. JTW enhanced the activity of Nrf2, 
regulated the Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathway, increased the activity of nerve growth 
factors, improved the cholinergic nervous system, inhibited inflammatory factors 
and oxidative stress, and ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) associates closely associated with the activation of 
NADPH oxidase (Nox) isozymes. CRB-2131, a novel oxadiazole derivative, is 
identified as a potently suppresses Nox isozymes. It inhibits reactive oxygen 
species production (ROS) by hippocampal neuronal and microglial cells and 
reduces microglial activation. Prophylactic (starting at 3.5 months of age) and 
therapeutic (starting at 6 months of age) oral administration with CRB-2131 for 
10 weeks in 5XFAD mice reduced hippocampal superoxide levels, lipid 
peroxidation, Tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Prophylactic and 
therapeutic CRB-2131 treatment of 5XFAD mice restored their impaired cognition 
as shown by the novel-object recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water-maze tests. 
CRB-2131 treatment increased mature neurons, reduced apoptotic mature neurons, 
and elevated immature neurons in the hippocampus. Positron-emission 
tomography/computed-tomography imaging confirmed that CRB-2131 stimulated 
neuronal regeneration. CRB-2131 suppresses brain oxidation, tauopathy, and 
neuroinflammation, thereby preventing mature neuron death and promoting neuron 
regeneration. Ultimately, this fosters a resilient brain and protects cognition.

The heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multi-dimensional, encompassing 
clinical features such as neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), rate of progression, 
age of onset, comorbidities, and neuropathological features such as 
co-pathologies, and represents the diverse outcomes of manifold genetic and 
environmental risk determinants. These diverse features of AD also vary 
significantly between sexes and across ancestral backgrounds, but the specific 
variations and causal mechanisms are not well understood. Recent technological 
advances, particularly single-cell and spatial omics, have provided new tools to 
dissect the molecular underpinnings of AD heterogeneity and its multifactorial 
nature. This perspective review highlights molecular differences, general and 
sex-specific, that contribute to the heterogeneity of AD in aspects such as NPS, 
co-pathology prevalence, and general disease trajectories. We further examined 
the potential for multiomic approaches to direct future translational studies 
aimed at the development of precision medicine strategies for the treatment of 
AD in all its diverse forms. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents 
diverse subtypes characterized by comorbid clinical symptoms and co-pathologies. 
Integration of bulk, single-cell, spatial multiomics reveals factors underlying 
AD variation. Multiomics studies indicate shared and distinct mechanisms between 
major psychiatric disorders and AD. Multiomics data have transformative 
implications for sex- and population-specific AD therapies. New tailored 
precision medicine strategies are needed to address the full range of complexity 
in AD.

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-binding calcium channels 
that play a key role in brain function and have been linked to many neurological 
disorders. NMDARs are multi-pass membrane heterotetrameric complexes composed of 
two compulsory GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 (A-D) or GluN3 (A-B) subunits, from 
which GluN1, GluN2B, GluN2A, and GluN3A are widely expressed in the adult brain. 
This study assesses the presence of GluN1, GluN2B, GluN2A, and GluN3A in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from healthy individuals, viral and autoimmune 
encephalitis, Huntington's disease (HD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. 
Samples were run in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and resolved with 
different anti-ectodomain and anti-C-terminal antibodies that combined with 
immunoprecipitation analyses, served to demonstrate the presence of full-length 
GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN3A in CSF. These NMDAR subunit complexes are not 
associated with extracellular vesicles. As a proof of concept of the identity of 
NMDAR subunits in the CSF, we demonstrated reduced levels of GluN1 in the CSF 
from patients with autoimmune encephalitis caused by anti-GluN1 antibodies 
compared with other causes of encephalitis; and showed a depletion of CSF GluN3A 
in a Grin3a knockout mouse model. Moreover, we observed higher GluN3A levels in 
CSF in both asymptomatic and symptomatic HD patients; while GluN2A levels were 
lower in CSF from AD patients. In conclusion, here we demonstrate the presence 
of NMDAR full-length subunits in CSF and that changes in NMDAR subunits balance 
could serve to identify alterations related to pathological conditions.

Lipofuscin autofluorescence confounds intracellular amyloid β detection in the 
aged mouse brain.

University, Niigata 951-8585, Japan.

Intracellular amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is a contentious feature of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasingly reported in young adults and aged animal 
models of AD. However, autofluorescent lipofuscin granules which consist of a 
mixture of highly oxidized lipids, misfolded proteins, and metals, accumulates 
with aging in neurons and microglia and renders difficult the interpretation of 
immunofluorescence-based studies. Here, we show that lipofuscin accumulation in 
aged wild-type (WT) mouse brains exhibits significant spectral overlap with 
commonly used antibodies for Aβ detection, leading to potential 
misinterpretation of intracellular Aβ signals. Through a combination of dye 
staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and confocal microscopy, we show that 
fluorescence signals resembling intracellular Aβ and commonly reported in aged 
animal models of AD, may reflect the presence of lipofuscin granules. 
Importantly, these signals persisted in control sections where primary Aβ 
antibodies were omitted, but disappeared following TrueBlack autofluorescence 
quencher. We also performed Aβ immunofluorescence staining using 5xFAD mice as 
model for AD, revealing that intracellular Aβ in these models can be diminished 
by TrueBlack treatment, thus confounding the interpretation of true 
intracellular Aβ signals. Our findings underscore the need for caution in 
interpreting intracellular Aβ signals in young adults and aged models of Aβ 
pathology inside neurons or microglia.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) and related conditions are known to affect 
decision-making (DM), particularly in older adult populations. The intersection 
of CI and DM ability is crucial in end-of-life (EoL) care, where there is a 
confluence of heterogenous preferences and values often across different 
constituents (e.g., healthcare providers, family members, and proxies). 
Standardized questionnaires are necessary to characterize patients' EoL 
decisions, preferences, and readiness, but the extent of available measures is 
widely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to summarize the current state of the 
literature regarding EoL decision-making measures. This effort supports the 
development of the Advancing Reliable Measurement in Cognitive Aging and 
Decision-making Ability (ARMCADA) research initiative, which seeks to develop a 
decision-making battery for use in older adults.
METHODS: Following the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a scoping 
review for multiple domains of DM in studies published between January 2018 and 
November 2023. Any paper that assessed or characterized DM in participants 
45 years and older was extracted for the DM domain, population characteristics, 
and DM measures.
RESULTS: An initial search identified 16,286 articles, of which 705 were 
classified as assessing DM. Of those, 34 articles included measures of the EoL 
domain, and 28 unique measures were identified. The MacArthur Competence 
Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T), the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), 
and the Decision Regret Scale (DRS) were the only assessments used more than 
once in the scoping review. Many studies assessed clinical populations, 
including those with CI/dementia (12%), cancer (24%), and chronic conditions 
(16%). Findings show that measures used at the end of life emphasize decisional 
preferences, efficacy, and conflict.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this review highlights the lack of DM ability measures that 
can assess older adults' capacity to make decisions regarding EoL-specific 
issues (e.g., life-sustaining treatment and pain management).

Memory reconsolidation impairment by amyloid beta (1-42) and its prevention by 
non-competitive antagonists of NMDA receptors.

In a healthy brain, the reactivation of memories under conditions of novelty 
leads to their labilization and subsequent reconsolidation. However, if 
plasticity of the nervous system is reduced reconsolidation mechanisms may be 
disrupted, leading to weakening and loss of existing memory. We hypothesize that 
such self-degradation of old memory due to its reactivation in the compromised 
brain may lead to progressive memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. Preventing 
memory lability when accessing it, may slow down such engram degradation. To 
test these hypotheses, we first examined whether beta-amyloid peptide Aβ1-42 can 
impair reconsolidation of memory in one-trial passive avoidance task in young 
chicks. Next, we examined the possibility to prevent such reminder-associated 
amnesia by administering a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 
antagonist MK-801 prior to memory reactivation. Finally, we compared the memory 
protecting effects of two non-competitive NMDA antagonists, MK-801 and memantine 
which is a clinically used medication for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We 
found that administration of Aβ1-42 prior to memory reactivation in passive 
avoidance task in chicks impaired its subsequent reconsolidation. Concurrent 
systemic injection of MK-801 or memantine prevented this impairment. Our data 
thus support the hypothesis about the possible role of impaired reconsolidation 
in the progressive deterioration of old memories in neurodegenerative diseases, 
particularly in Alzheimer's disease. This hypothesis offers a new explanation 
for the protective effects of memantine and suggests the possibility of similar 
effects with other NMDA receptor antagonists.

BACKGROUND: Multiple medical conditions arising from reduced physical and 
physiological functioning, including cognitive decline, manifest in older 
persons. This study aims to examine the relationship between cognitive function 
and associated risk factors in older persons living in long-term care facilities 
in Indonesia.
METHODS: This study involved 350 elderly individuals residing in long-term care 
institutions. A cross-sectional design utilizing an analytical survey 
methodology was implemented. Data were gathered via interviews employing a 
demographic questionnaire and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). 
Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 23).
RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated significant correlations between 
cognitive performance and gender, ethnicity, level of education, medical 
history, subjective memory issues, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, dietary 
intake of fruits and vegetables, and employment history (p < 0.05). Higher 
education (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.84) and reduced subjective memory 
complaints (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20-0.44) correlated positively with enhanced 
cognitive function, but alcohol intake (OR = 6.79, 95% CI: 2.42-19.1) correlated 
with impaired cognitive function.
CONCLUSIONS: the level of education, subjective memory complaints, and alcohol 
intake are substantially correlated with cognitive performance in older persons 
residing in long-term care facilities. Evaluating demographic characteristics in 
elderly individuals can assist healthcare professionals in the early detection 
of cognitive impairment, facilitating prompt interventions in long-term care 
environments.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorders linked to 
gut microbiota dysbiosis, may benefit from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
interventions.
OBJECTIVES: Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a classic traditional Chinese Medicine 
(TCM) formula. This study investigated whether Danggui Shaoyao San and its 
disassembled prescriptions could improve cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice by 
modulating the structure of the gut microbiota, thereby providing a theoretical 
basis for AD treatment and the further development and application of Danggui 
Shaoyao San.
METHODS: Forty APP/PS1 and eight C57BL/6 mice were divided into six groups: DSS 
(6.4 g/kg/d), QDW (4.6 g/kg/d), DW (1.8 g/kg/d), GV971 (positive control, 40 
mg/kg/d), model (saline), and control (saline). After 60 days of treatment, the 
mice underwent behavioral testing in the open field, novel object recognition, 
and water maze. Gut microbiota composition, diversity, and function were then 
analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The results of Behavioral experiment indicate that Danggui Shaoyao San 
and its disassembled prescriptions can ameliorate spatial memory deficits 
(Morris water maze), enhance recognition memory (novel object recognition), and 
reduce anxiety-like behaviors (open field test), with the DSS group 
demonstrating the most pronounced effects. In addition, through 16S sequencing 
analysis we predicted DSS and its disassembled prescriptions reduced harmful 
bacteria (Firmicutes, Akkermansia) while increasing beneficial bacteria 
(Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus). DSS restored microbial 
diversity closest to healthy controls, evidenced by elevated Chao1/Shannon 
indices and reduced Simpson index. Beta diversity revealed structural divergence 
between treatment and model groups. Functional predictions highlighted enriched 
pathways (D-glutamine metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis) and suppressed 
antibiotic biosynthesis.
CONCLUSION: Danggui Shaoyao San and its disassembled prescriptions ameliorate 
AD-related cognitive impairment and gut dysbiosis, enhance microbial diversity, 
and modulate metabolic pathways, supporting their therapeutic potential via 
gut-brain axis regulation. This study elucidates the multi-target mechanisms of 
DSS in AD treatment, advancing TCM rationalization for neurodegenerative 
disorders.

Due to the low concentration of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in plasma and the high content 
of interfering factors, the conventional detection method for the quantification 
of Aβ still faces the problem of insufficient limit of detection (LOD). In this 
work, we propose a new light-triggered graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure 
(G-BP) field-effect transistor (FET) biosensing platform that achieves a 
​​marked​​ reduction in the LOD. The LOD for Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker 
Aβ42 detection using the G-BP FET is as low as 235.1 zM (2.351 × 10-19 M), which 
is the lowest value reported to date and is approximately 2 to 3 orders of 
magnitude lower than other reported biosensing platforms. The G-BP FET platform 
provides precise, real-time guidance for non-invasive early diagnosis, disease 
monitoring, and personalized treatment plans for AD. Moreover, this method has 
good scalability and potential applications in other areas, including early 
detection of cancer and other major chronic diseases.

Recurrent Cholinergic Crisis Caused by Therapeutic-Dose Rivastigmine Patch in an 
Elderly Patient With Alzheimer's Disease: A Case Report.

Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are widely used for the treatment of dementia 
and other conditions, but may rarely cause cholinergic crisis, a potentially 
life-threatening complication. We report an elderly female patient with 
Alzheimer's disease who experienced three episodes of cholinergic crisis over 32 
months while receiving a therapeutic dose of transdermal rivastigmine (18 
mg/day). Each episode involved vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and neurological 
symptoms, with marked reductions in serum cholinesterase levels (53-63 U/L at 
presentation). During the first two episodes, alternative diagnoses such as 
acute gastroenteritis and possible pesticide exposure were initially suspected, 
and cholinergic crisis secondary to rivastigmine was not recognized. After the 
third episode, rivastigmine was permanently discontinued, resulting in the 
complete resolution of both acute and chronic mild gastrointestinal and 
autonomic symptoms. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of 
cholinergic crisis in elderly patients receiving ChEIs and underscores the 
importance of considering this condition when unexplained gastrointestinal or 
autonomic symptoms occur even during standard therapeutic dosing.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, constitutes 
a major global health burden with escalating socioeconomic costs. The precise 
pathophysiological cascades and etiological underpinnings of AD remain 
incompletely elucidated. Current amyloid-beta (Aβ)-targeted therapies 
demonstrate limited clinical efficacy and significant adverse effects, prompting 
reevaluation of therapeutic development strategies. This therapeutic impasse 
underscores the imperative to investigate novel pathogenic pathways and identify 
viable molecular targets. PANoptosis, a coordinated cell death mechanism 
integrating pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, has emerged as a 
pathophysiological nexus in diverse conditions spanning infectious diseases, 
malignancies, and chronic inflammatory disorders. Fundamentally, universal 
apoptosis represents a holistic framework. The integration of these key 
components generates a novel conceptualization, with all elements being 
indispensable. The absence of any one element precludes the formation of 
PANoptosis. Direct evidence that PANoptosis regulates AD pathogenesis is 
currently lacking. This review synthesizes current understanding of PANoptosis 
molecular drivers and evaluates their potential mechanistic contributions to AD 
pathogenesis, proposing a framework for developing possible targeted 
neuroprotective strategies.

Balancing Speed and Sensitivity: Echo-Planar Accelerated MRI for ARIA-H 
Screening in Anti-Aβ Therapeutics.

Hagiwara A.

The recent advent of anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies has introduced new 
demands for MRI-based screening of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, 
particularly the hemorrhage subtype (ARIA-H). In this editorial, we discuss the 
study by Loftus and colleagues, which evaluates the diagnostic performance of 
echo-planar accelerated gradient-recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted 
imaging (SWI) sequences for ARIA-H screening. Their results demonstrate that 
significant scan time reductions-up to 86%-can be achieved without substantial 
loss in diagnostic accuracy, particularly for accelerated GRE. These findings 
align with recently issued MRI guidelines and offer practical solutions for 
improving workflow efficiency in Alzheimer's care. However, challenges remain in 
terms of inter-rater variability and image quality, especially with accelerated 
SWI. We also highlight the emerging role of artificial intelligence-assisted 
analysis and the importance of reproducibility and data sharing in advancing 
clinical implementation. Balancing speed and sensitivity remains a central theme 
in optimizing imaging strategies for antiamyloid therapeutic protocols.

Intranasal delivery offers a promising route for direct drug transport to the 
central nervous system, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and improving 
therapeutic outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. 
Donepezil, a widely prescribed drug for Alzheimer's, suffers from poor oral 
bioavailability, delayed onset, and limited nootropic activity due to extensive 
systemic metabolism. To address these limitations, this study aimed to develop 
and optimize a Donepezil-loaded lipid-based nanoemulsion for enhanced 
nose-to-brain delivery. A Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was employed to optimize 
three formulation variables: drug-to-lipid ratio (1:2 to 1:6), surfactant 
concentration (1-2% w/v), and stirring speed (1500-2500 rpm), with their effects 
assessed on particle size, drug entrapment efficiency, and drug loading. Based 
on solubility and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance, Glyceryl Monostearate and 
Tween 80 were selected as excipients. Seventeen formulations were prepared and 
analyzed using Response Surface Methodology. The optimized formulation (Batch 
18) exhibited a particle size of 160.12 nm, entrapment efficiency of 80.75%, and 
drug loading of 19.98%, with a desirability score of 0.977. Predicted and 
observed values were within ±5% variation, confirming model reliability with 
high Adjusted R² (>0.95), Predicted R² (>0.90), and a non-significant lack of 
fit (p > 0.05) by ANOVA. The optimized nanoemulsion showed enhanced 
brain-targeting efficiency and improved nootropic potential of Donepezil via the 
intranasal route, presenting a promising strategy for Alzheimer's therapy. 
However, the study was limited to in vitro assessments, and further in vivo 
pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and long-term safety evaluations are warranted 
to comprehensively establish its therapeutic potential.
