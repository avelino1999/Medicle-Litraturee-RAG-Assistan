PURPOSE: This study investigated the association between swept-source OCTA 
(SS-OCTA) choriocapillaris flow deficit percentage (CC FD%) and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) biomarkers in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Twenty-three cognitively healthy (CH) participants, including those 
with pathological (CH-PAT) and normal (CH-NAT) Aβ42/tau ratios, underwent lumbar 
puncture for CSF Aβ42/tau and ptau-181 quantification using 
electrochemiluminescence assays. OCTA en face images of the choriocapillaris 
were analyzed for flow deficits within a 6 × 6 mm macular grid and 3- and 6-mm 
Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) perifoveal rings. The 
association between CC FD% and CSF Aβ42/tau and CSF ptau-181 levels was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Perifoveal microvascular changes in the choriocapillaris outer ring 
(6-mm ETDRS ring) were significantly correlated with the CSF Aβ42/tau ratio in 
CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs. However, linear regression analysis across all CH 
participants (CH-PAT + CH-NAT) revealed that only age was significantly 
associated with CSF ptau-181 levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that this cohort is in an early preclinical AD 
stage, without ptau-181 biomarker evidence of established AD. SS-OCTA measures 
may complement CSF A/T (amyloid/tau) levels, helping to define transitional 
stages from CH-NAT to CH-PAT during presymptomatic AD.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: By identifying the transition from normal aging to 
presymptomatic AD, SS-OCTA metrics combined with biofluid markers could enhance 
AD oculomics by stratifying disease risk and prioritizing treatment 
interventions.

Neural-activated optogenetics technique contributing to the "restart" of 
degenerative neurons offers hope for the treatment of several neurodegenerative 
diseases. However, the limitations of persistent invasiveness and inadequate 
repair of the pathological environment strongly hinder its further application. 
Here, a concept of differentiating stem cells is proposed to produce functional 
materials to enhance the therapeutic applicability of optogenetics. Induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated to generate the "tentacled" 
stem cells TenSCs. Their "tentacled" vesicles TenSCev, upon inheriting the 
biological functions of the parent cell, will possess both neural targeting 
capacity and pathological environment repair ability. Hence, TenSCev are 
utilized as functional carrier to deliver optogenetics elements for completely 
non-traumatic and controllable neuron activation, while also facilitating the 
comprehensive restoration of the pathological environment, thus effectively 
halted disease progression and significantly improved cognitive function in 
Alzheimer's disease or aged mice. Further, the concept of generating specialized 
biomaterials from differentiated stem cells as functional carriers holds the 
potential to broaden the applicability of various neuroregulatory techniques in 
the treatment of neurological disorders.

Nanomedicines are nanoscale, biocompatible materials that offer promising 
alternatives to conventional treatment options for brain disorders. The recent 
technological developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine 
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), are transforming the nanomedicine field by 
improving disease diagnosis, biomarker identification, prognostic assessment and 
disease monitoring, targeted drug delivery, and therapeutic intervention as well 
as contributing to computational and methodological developments. These 
advancements can be achieved by analysis of large clinical datasets and 
facilitating the design and optimization of nanomaterials for in vivo testing. 
Such advancement offers exciting possibilities for the improvement in the 
management of brain disorders, including brain cancer, Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, where early diagnosis, targeted 
delivery, and effective treatment strategies remain a great challenge. This 
review article provides an overview of recent advances in AI-based nanomedicine 
development to accelerate effective and quick diagnosis, biomarker 
identification, prognosis, drug delivery, methodological advancement and 
patient-specific therapies for managing brain disorders.

Background Changes in mode of transportation, such as driving cessation, elevate 
the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease among older 
adults residing in communities. However, the association between 
transportation-related lifestyles and cognitive function in older adults with 
MCI remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between 
mobility independence and cognitive dysfunction among older patients with MCI. 
Methods This was a retrospective study of community-dwelling adults aged 65 
years or older from Usuki, Oita Prefecture, Japan. Data from 117 participants 
with MCI were analyzed. Using the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
scale, participants were categorized into independent and dependent mobility 
groups based on their mode of transportation. Cognitive function was assessed 
using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Japanese version of the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J), and scores were compared across modes of 
transportation. Results Significant differences were found in total MoCA-J 
scores, visuospatial executive function, naming, and orientation, and MMSE 
orientation of time and place, with higher scores observed in the independent 
mobility group compared to the dependent group (p < 0.05). Analysis of 
covariance further supported these findings, showing higher scores in total 
MoCA-J and MMSE scores in the independent mobility group. Conclusions This study 
highlights the relationship between daily mode of transportation and cognitive 
function in patients with MCI. Participants with independent mobility exhibited 
superior cognitive function compared to the dependent mobility group. These 
findings may contribute to the development of new interventions for preventing 
the transition from MCI to dementia by further validation of causal 
relationships in longitudinal or intervention studies.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a crucial part of the B-cell receptor 
signaling pathway that has been extensively studied in various types of 
malignancies. Recent studies have extended our knowledge on its role in 
metabolism as well as neurological disorders. It may play an important role in 
the pathophysiology of neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, 
Alzheimer's disease, brain injury, and several others. Activation of 
inflammasomes, mainly NLRP3, is one of the core mechanisms by which it promotes 
inflammation in the brain related to aging and diseases. In this paper, we 
provide an overview of the less explored roles of BTK in several brain diseases 
and discuss the potential of its inhibition to become a therapeutic target for 
neurological diseases.

Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive dementia and brain accumulation of 
Aβ-peptide-containing plaques, gliosis, neuroimmune changes, and neurofibrillary 
tangles. Mushroom polysaccharides have been previously reported to have 
anti-neuroinflammation activity through the gut-brain axis. This study aimed to 
evaluate whether a dietary intervention with Phallus atrovolvatus, a recently 
identified edible mushroom in Thailand, could have a benefit on gut health and 
alleviate AD-related changes. Methods: Male and female 6-8-month-old littermate 
wild-type control (C57BL/6J) and AppNL-G-F mice were randomly assigned to either 
a control diet or a diet supplemented with mushroom aqueous extract (MAE) for 8 
weeks to quantify changes in body weight, intestine, immune cells, short chain 
fatty acids, brain cytokines, amyloid-β (Aβ) levels, gliosis, and memory. 
Results: MAE had no adverse effects on gut leakiness and increased pyruvate 
levels in serum. Splenocyte immune profiling revealed a significant increase in 
the frequency of IgM+, IA_IE+, and CD14+ cells in MAE-administered 
AppNL-G-Ffemale mice compared to their vehicle controls. AppNL-G-Fmale mice that 
received MAE showed a significant increase in the frequency of cytotoxic CD8 T 
cells within the cervical lymph nodes compared to their wild-type counterparts. 
Aβ deposition and gliosis were significantly reduced in the hippocampi of the 
MAE-supplemented AppNL-G-F groups. However, MAE feeding did not alter spatial 
recognition memory in either sex or genotype compared to their vehicle groups. 
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that the administration of P. 
atrovolvatus aqueous extract showed neuroprotective potential against AD-related 
changes in the brain with no adverse impact on gut health and memory.

Background: Individual nutrients are associated with cognitive performance, but 
there is less evidence on the relationship between overall dietary patterns and 
cognitive performance in midlife. Objective: To examine the relation between 
dietary patterns and cognitive performance in midlife adults within the Bogalusa 
Heart Study (BHS). Methods: Cross-sectional data from the 2013-2016 cycle of the 
Bogalusa Heart Study, a life-course prospective cohort study, were used to 
generate diet quality scores, including the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 
(AHEI), the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI), and the Alternate Mediterranean 
Dietary Pattern (aMed), based on food frequency questionnaires. Cognitive scores 
assessing attention and processing, episodic memory, and executive function were 
generated through validated cognitive tests. Generalized linear and logistic 
regression models were fit with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: 
Of 1053 participants included in the analysis, the mean age was 48.18 (SD = 
5.22) years; 38.94% were male; and 31.14% identified as Black. Higher diet 
quality scores were associated with a higher global cognitive score (P-trend = 
0.01 for AHEI, 0.02 for HEI, and 0.04 for aMed) after adjusting for age, sex, 
race, employment, education, smoking status, total energy intake, physical 
activity, BMI, diabetes, and hypertension. In dichotomous outcome analyses, 
higher AHEI and aMed scores remained inversely associated with low cognition 
when adjusting for similar covariates (P-trend = 0.03 for AHEI, 0.03 for aMed), 
but the association was attenuated to non-significance for HEI. In joint effect 
analysis between employment and dietary patterns (P-interaction = 0.28 for AHEI, 
0.01 for HEI, and 0.11 for aMed), unemployment with a lower quality diet was 
associated with lower cognitive performance (P-trend = 0.02 for AHEI, 0.02 for 
HEI, and 0.01 for aMed). Conclusions: A high-quality diet is associated with 
optimal cognitive performance among midlife adults, and unemployment status may 
influence this association. These findings suggest that dietary interventions 
during midlife may represent a public health strategy to preserve cognitive 
function and reduce future neurodegenerative disease burden, especially in 
disadvantaged populations.

Natural products derived from traditional Chinese medicine have received 
significant attention as potential treatments for neurodegenerative disorders 
due to their wide availability, demonstrated efficacy, and favorable safety 
profiles. Intranasal delivery provides distinct advantages for targeting the 
central nervous system (CNS), enabling direct therapeutic agent delivery to the 
brain by bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This review evaluates natural 
products administered intranasally for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), 
highlighting their therapeutic potential and addressing formulation challenges 
related to physicochemical properties. Strategic optimization approaches are 
proposed, including novel carrier systems, molecular modifications, and 
combination therapies. By discussing current difficulties and offering practical 
recommendations, this review aims to encourage further scholarly research and 
clinical application.

Background/Objectives: Lipoxins, particularly Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), are endogenous 
lipid mediators with potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties, 
making them promising candidates for the treatment of inflammatory and 
neurodegenerative disorders. However, their therapeutic application is limited 
by poor stability and bioavailability. This study aimed to develop and 
characterize nanomicelles encapsulating LXA4 (nano-lipoxin A4) to improve its 
pharmacological efficacy against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative 
condition marked by chronic inflammation and beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation. 
Methods: Nano-lipoxin A4 was synthesized using Pluronic F-127 as a carrier and 
characterized in terms of morphology, physicochemical stability, and in vitro 
activity against Aβ fibrils. Dissociation of Aβ fibrils was assessed via 
Thioflavin-T fluorescence assays and transmission electron microscopy. In vivo 
biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles were evaluated using 
technetium-99m-labeled nano-lipoxin A4 in rodent models. Hepatic biochemical 
parameters were also measured to assess potential systemic effects. Results: In 
vitro studies demonstrated that nano-lipoxin A4 effectively dissociated Aβ 
fibrils at concentrations of 50 nM and 112 nM. Electron microscopy confirmed the 
disruption of fibrillar structures. In vivo imaging revealed predominant 
accumulation in the liver and spleen, consistent with reticuloendothelial system 
uptake. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a prolonged half-life (63.95 h) and low 
clearance rate (0.001509 L/h), indicating sustained systemic presence. 
Biochemical assays revealed elevated liver enzyme levels, suggestive of 
increased hepatic metabolism or potential hepatotoxicity. Conclusions: 
Nano-lipoxin A4 exhibits significant therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's 
disease through effective modulation of Aβ pathology and favorable 
pharmacokinetic characteristics. However, the elevation in liver enzymes 
necessitates further investigation into systemic safety to support clinical 
translation.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
disease, due to their multifaced and complicated nature, remain uncurable and 
impose substantial financial and human burdens on society. Therefore, developing 
new innovative therapeutic strategies is vital. In this context, drug 
repurposing has emerged as a promising avenue to expedite the development of 
treatments for these challenging conditions. One particularly compelling target 
in this regard is the chaperone protein sigma-1 receptor (S1R), which has 
garnered significant attention for its neuroprotective properties. 
Interestingly, several medications, including fluvoxamine (an antidepressant), 
dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant), and amantadine (an antiviral), which 
were initially developed for unrelated indications, have shown encouraging 
results in neurodegenerative therapy through S1R activation. These findings 
suggest that existing drugs in pharmacopeias can play an essential role in 
alleviating neurodegenerative symptoms by modulating S1R, thereby offering a 
faster route and cost-effective path to clinical applications compared to the de 
novo development of entirely new compounds. Furthermore, as a synergistic 
benefit, combining S1R-targeting drugs with other therapeutic agents may also 
improve treatment efficacy. In this review, we highlight key repurposed drugs 
targeting S1R and explore their mechanisms of action, shedding light on their 
emerging therapeutic potential in the fight against neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by the 
accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers. These oligomers are thought 
to cause synaptic dysfunction and contribute to neurodegeneration. CT1812 is a 
small-molecule sigma-2 receptor antagonist that is currently being investigated 
and tested as a potential disease-modifying treatment for AD. CT1812 acts by 
displacing Aβ oligomers into the cerebrospinal fluid and preventing their 
interaction with receptors on neurons. Preclinical studies and early clinical 
trials of CT1812 show promising results and provide evidence for its potential 
to slow AD progression. This review outlines the role of Aβ oligomers in AD, 
CT1812's mechanism of action, and the effectiveness and limitations of CT1812 
based on preclinical and clinical studies.

In addition to the classically accepted pathophysiological features of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasing attention is paid to the role of the 
insulin-resistant state of the central nervous system. Glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor (GLP-1R) agonism demonstrated neuroprotective consequences by 
mitigating neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. The present review aims to 
offer a comprehensive overview of the neuroprotective properties of GLP-1R 
agonists (GLP-1RAs), with a particular focus on experimental animal models of 
AD. Ameliorated amyloid-β plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation and 
deposition following exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide treatment was 
confirmed in several models. The GLP-1RAs studied alleviated central insulin 
resistance, as evidenced by the decreased serine phosphorylation of insulin 
receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and restored downstream phosphoinositide 
3-kinase/RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase (PI3K/Akt) signaling. Furthermore, 
the GLP-1RAs influenced multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases 
(extracellular signal-regulated kinase: ERK; c-Jun N-terminal kinase: JNK, p38) 
positively and suppressed glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3β) hyperactivation. A 
lower proportion of reactive microglia and astrocytes was associated with better 
neuronal preservation following their administration. Finally, restoration of 
cognitive functions, particularly spatial memory, was also observed for 
semaglutide and dulaglutide. GLP-1RAs, therefore, hold promising 
disease-modifying potential in the management of AD.

Africa, with the type locality being South Africa. This species is rich in a 
diverse array of bioactive compounds, including various polysaccharides, 
glycopeptide macromolecules, and various small-molecule compounds, such as 
sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, steroids, and alkaloids. Research indicates that 
these chemical constituents exhibit numerous pharmacological properties, 
including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor activities, as well as 
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, reduction in blood lipids, and promotion of 
neural synapse growth. Apart from its use in traditional Chinese medicine, the 
components of G. capense are utilized globally for the treatment of a wide range 
of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, febrile convulsions, HIV, and 
diabetes. This underscores the extensive medical applications of G. capense, 
emphasizing its significance in contemporary and traditional healthcare. This 
review summarizes the latest research findings on the bioactive compounds and 
pharmacological effects of G. capense, compiled from databases such as PubMed, 
Web of Science, and Elsevier. This study aimed at providing researchers in this 
field with in-depth scientific insights and guidance, promoting further

Celery (Apium graveolens L.), one of the numerous members of the Apiaceae 
family, has been traditionally used as food and medicine due to its 
nutraceutical properties. Nevertheless, understanding the neuroprotective 
effects of this species requires evaluation through different mechanisms 
relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. This study explored the 
neuroprotective potential of ethanolic extracts of celery leaves. Liquid 
chromatography and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis of the extract 
revealed the existence of a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including 
phenolic acids, hydroxycinnamic acid, flavonoids, flavonoid O-glycosides, 
flavonol, glycosides, and isoflavones. Celery extract protects human 
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against 15 µM amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42) toxicity, 
enhancing their vitality from 67% to 81.74% at 100 µg/mL. The extract inhibited 
the enzymes associated with AD, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), 
cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) with IC50 values of 
21.84, 61.27, 45.94, 34.1, and 52.2 µg/mL, respectively. In conclusion, celery 
leaf extract components may be potential therapeutic candidates for AD 
prevention and treatment.

The publication focuses on the innovative applications of PROTAC 
(proteolysis-targeting chimera) technology in modern pharmacotherapy, with 
particular emphasis on cancer treatment. PROTACs represent an advanced 
therapeutic strategy that enables selective protein degradation, opening new 
possibilities in drug design. This technology shows potential in the treatment 
of cancers, viral infections (such as HIV and COVID-19), and chronic diseases 
including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, atopic dermatitis, and 
Huntington's disease. Promising results from clinical studies on the compound 
ARV-471 confirm the effectiveness of this approach. New types of PROTACs, like 
TF-PROTAC and PhosphoTAC, are designed to enhance the effectiveness, stability, 
and absorption of treatment drugs. The conclusions of the review highlight the 
broad therapeutic potential of PROTACs in various diseases and their relevance 
for the future of therapies, particularly in oncology.

A series of 21 novel coumarin-triazole-isatin hybrids was synthesized and 
evaluated for their potential as multitarget agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
The compounds featured variations in alkyl linker length that connects coumarin 
and triazole and substitution at the 5-position of the isatin ring. Several 
derivatives showed potent butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition with 
selectivity over acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The lead compound, 6c1, exhibited 
strong BChE inhibition (IC50 = 1.74 μM), surpassing donepezil. Enzyme kinetics 
revealed a mixed-type mechanism, while molecular docking studies confirmed dual 
binding at catalytic and peripheral sites. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
analysis highlighted the influence of linker flexibility and steric/electronic 
effects of substituents. The observed BChE selectivity, combined with favorable 
in vitro profiles, identifies these hybrids as promising leads for AD drug 
development.

Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), plays a critical role in alleviating the symptoms 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by regulating acetylcholine levels, emerging as an 
attractive target for AD treatment. This study employed a quantitative 
structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model based on ECFP4 molecular 
fingerprints with several machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, RF, SVM, KNN), 
among which the XGBoost model showed the best performance (AUC = 0.9740). A 
hybrid strategy integrating ligand- and structure-based virtual screening 
identified 12 hits from the Topscience core database, three of which were 
identified for the first time. Among them, piboserod and Rotigotine demonstrated 
the best BChE inhibitory potency (IC50 = 15.33 μM and 12.76 μM, respectively) 
and exhibited favorable safety profiles as well as neuroprotective effects in 
vitro. Notably, Rotigotine, a marketed drug, was newly recognized for its 
anti-AD potential, with further enzyme kinetic analyses revealing that it acts 
as a mixed-type inhibitor in a non-competitive mode. Fluorescence spectroscopy, 
molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations further clarified their 
binding modes and stability. This study provides an innovative screening 
strategy for the discovery of BChE inhibitors, which not only identifies 
promising drug candidates for the treatment of AD but also demonstrates the 
potential of machine learning in drug discovery.

Amaryllidaceae alkaloids from the Amaryllidoideae subfamily exhibit broad 
pharmacological activities, including neuroprotection and anticancer effects. 
Galanthamine is a key compound for Alzheimer's therapy. The Hippeastrum genus, 
particularly in Bolivia, offers significant potential for novel drug discovery, 
emphasising the need for conservation and further phytochemical research. 
Twenty-seven samples from Bolivian Hippeastrum species were investigated in 
terms of their alkaloid profile and anticholinesterase activity. The 
phytochemical analysis of Bolivian Hippeastrum species via GC-MS identified 48 
Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, displaying diverse structural groups with potential 
pharmacological significance. Lycorine- and Homolycorine-type alkaloids were 
predominant, particularly in H. chionedyanthum and H. haywardii, with high 
concentrations of lycorine, a promising anticancer compound. The species H. 
evansiarum and H. mollevillquense contained notable quantities of Galanthamine 
type alkaloids, relevant for Alzheimer's treatment. This study also highlights 
variability in acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory 
activities, with H. lara-ricoi and H. haywardii demonstrating strong inhibition. 
These findings suggest that Hippeastrum species are a valuable source of 
bioactive compounds, warranting further research into their therapeutic 
applications.

In this study, we have examined the neuroprotective effects of cannabidiolic 
acid (CBDA) in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used in vitro 
electrophysiological recording in hippocampal slices and performed proteomic 
analysis of cortical tissue from APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. In wild-type (WT) 
slices from C57BL6 mice, acute treatment with CBDA (10 μM) did not alter levels 
of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP); however, it did reverse the 
attenuation of LTP produced by acute beta amyloid peptide (Aβ42). We also 
examined the effects of CBDA or vehicle in APP/PS1 mice and WT littermates over 
a 5-week period at 8 months. LTP levels recorded in slices from WT mice treated 
with CBDA at 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg (IP) or vehicle were similar. LTP was attenuated 
in slices from vehicle-treated APP/PS1 compared to vehicle-treated WT mice, 
while treatment of APP/PS1 mice with all doses of CBDA reversed the deficits in 
LTP. There was also a deficit in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in 
vehicle-treated APP/PS1 compared to WT, indicating altered synaptic function and 
transmitter release; this was reversed in slices from CBDA-treated APP/PS1 mice. 
Levels of cortical soluble Aβ42 were similar across CBDA- and vehicle-treated 
groups; however, the level of aggregated Aβ42 was decreased in the CBDA-treated 
group. Proteomic analysis of cortical tissue from APP/PS1 cortex compared to WT 
revealed alterations in protein expression, with pathway enrichment analyses 
suggesting implicated canonical pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction, 
protein sorting, and synaptogenesis; all were significantly improved by CBDA 
treatment. These changes likely facilitate the improvement in synaptic 
transmission and LTP we observed following CBDA treatment in APP/PS1 mice. This 
research suggests that CBDA should be considered a novel therapy for AD.

Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as an important player in the pathobiology 
of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
Huntington's diseases. Aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and 
dysregulated non-coding RNAs have been shown to contribute to neuronal 
dysfunction and degeneration. These alterations are often exacerbated by 
environmental toxins, which induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and genomic 
instability. Reversing epigenetic aberrations may offer an avenue for restoring 
brain mechanisms and mitigating neurodegeneration. Herein, we revisit the 
evidence suggesting the ameliorative effects of epigenetic modulators in 
toxin-induced models of NDDs. The restoration of normal gene expressions, the 
improvement of neuronal function, and the reduction in pathological markers by 
histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors have been 
demonstrated in preclinical models of NDDs. Encouragingly, in clinical trials of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), HDAC inhibitors have caused improvements in cognition 
and memory. Combining these beneficial effects of epigenetic modulators with 
neuroprotective agents and the clearance of misfolded amyloid proteins may offer 
synergistic benefits. Reinforced by the emerging methods for more effective and 
brain-specific delivery, reversibility, and safety considerations, epigenetic 
modulators are anticipated to minimize systemic toxicity and yield more 
favorable outcomes in NDDs. In summary, although still in their infancy, 
epigenetic modulators offer an integrated strategy to address the multifactorial 
nature of NDDs, altering their therapeutic landscape.

Aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive multiorgan 
deterioration that compromises the quality of life. Unhealthy aging often 
associates with cognitive decline and motor-neurological disorders including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Genetic, 
environmental, and lifestyle factors, which include dietary habits, interact 
with aging and influence brain health, thus having an impact on the development 
of neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, fungal-derived bioactive 
compounds have emerged as promising neuroprotective agents due to their diverse 
biological properties that include antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, 
pro-autophagic, and neurotrophic effects. Key fungal metabolites, including 
polysaccharides, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds have been shown 
to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways, enhance neuronal survival, stimulate 
protective autophagy, and promote synaptic plasticity. Still, challenges related 
to their bioavailability, standardization, and clinical translation remain 
unresolved. Future deep research will be crucial to unlocking the full 
therapeutic potential of fungal-derived neuroprotective compounds. This review 
examines the potential therapeutic role of fungal metabolites, providing a 
comparative evaluation with a focus on their mechanisms of action in promoting 
brain health and longevity.

Myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6) is commonly found in 
plant-derived foods and has important pharmacological properties against many 
pathologies. One of them appears to be neurodegeneration, which is notably 
stimulated by dysregulated metal metabolism. Consequently, we explore the role 
of IP6 in mitigating neurodegenerative events catalyzed by dysregulated free 
iron. More precisely, we performed spectrophotometric measurements in aqueous 
solutions to investigate the ability of IP6 to chelate Fe3+ and inhibit its role 
in catalyzing the oxidative degradation of dopamine and ascorbic acid, two key 
molecules in neuronal redox systems. Our results demonstrate that IP6 
effectively prevents the formation of harmful intermediates, such as 
neuromelanin and reactive oxygen species, which are linked to neuronal damage. 
Additionally, we assessed the effect of IP6 on Fe3+-induced protein aggregation, 
focusing on α-synuclein, which is closely associated with Parkinson's disease. 
Our data reveal that IP6 accelerates the conversion of toxic α-synuclein 
oligomers into less harmful amyloid fibrils, thereby reducing their neurotoxic 
potential. Our findings highlight the dual function of IP6 as a potent Fe3+ 
chelator and modulator of protein aggregation pathways, reinforcing its 
potential as a neuroprotective agent. Consequently, IP6 offers promising 
therapeutic potential for mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative 
disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

Neurodegenerative and mood disorders represent growing medical and social 
problems, many of which are produced by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, 
disruption in the metabolism of various neurotransmitters, and some disturbances 
in lipid/carbohydrate homeostasis. Biologically active plant compounds, 
including flavonoids, have been shown to exert a positive impact on central 
nervous system function. This review assesses the studies of naturally occurring 
flavonoids belonging to various polyphenol subclasses and their mechanisms of 
neuroprotective action, especially against neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Most of the studied phytochemicals 
possess anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. These 
phytochemicals have been considered as compounds that reduce the risk of 
developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and can be used in the treatment 
of neurological diseases. The neuroprotective actions of some flavonoids may 
entail mechanisms that regulate reactive oxygen species generation and modify 
inflammatory pathways, and they should be considered as therapeutic agents.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive impairment with amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Among these pathological features, 
microglial activation is hallmark of neuroinflammation. Chaga (Inonotus 
obliquus) extract has been traditionally used for its diverse pharmacological 
properties, including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. This study 
aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of INO10, an inotodiol-rich chaga 
extract, in murine BV2 microglial cells and a 3xTg-AD mouse model. In BV2 cells, 
INO10 significantly reduced LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), indicating its potent anti-inflammatory effects. Oral 
administration of INO10 significantly improved spatial memory in 3xTg-AD mice, 
as evidenced by increased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test. 
Furthermore, INO10 treatment attenuated neuroinflammation, as indicated by 
reduced microglial activation and downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that INO10 
exhibited favorable bioavailability, supporting its potential as a 
neuroprotective agent. Histological analysis further revealed a reduction in Ab 
accumulation and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus, accompanied by a marked 
decrease in neuroinflammatory markers. These findings suggest that INO10 
effectively mitigates AD-related pathology by reducing Aβ deposition, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to cognitive 
enhancement. Given its multi-target neuroprotective properties, INO10 may serve 
as a promising natural compound for AD treatment. Further investigations are 
warranted to elucidate its precise mechanisms and clinical applicability.

Neurological disorders, encompassing neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory 
conditions, present significant public health and clinical challenges. Recent 
research has elucidated the pivotal role of various enzymes in the onset and 
progression of these disorders. This review explores the therapeutic potential 
of targeting these enzymes with natural and synthetic molecules. Key enzymes, 
including acetylcholinesterase, monoamine oxidase, beta-secretase, tau kinases, 
caspases, and cyclooxygenase-2, are implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Modulating these enzymes 
can alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression, or reverse pathological 
changes. Natural molecules derived from plants, microbes, seaweeds, and animals 
have long been noted for their therapeutic potential. Their ability to interact 
with specific enzymes with high specificity and minimal side effects makes them 
promising candidates for treatment. These natural agents provide a foundation 
for developing targeted therapies with improved safety profiles. Simultaneously, 
the development of synthetic chemistry has resulted in molecules designed to 
inhibit neurodegenerative enzymes with precision. This review examines the 
progress in creating small molecules, peptides, and enzyme inhibitors through 
sophisticated drug design techniques. It evaluates the efficacy, safety, and 
mechanisms of these synthetic agents, highlighting their potential for clinical 
application. The review offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements 
in enzyme-targeted therapies for neurological disorders, covering both natural 
and synthetic molecules investigated in preclinical and clinical settings. It 
discusses the mechanisms through which these molecules exert their effects, the 
challenges faced in their development, and future research directions. By 
synthesizing current knowledge, this paper aims to illuminate the potential of 
enzyme-targeted interventions in managing neurological disorders, showcasing 
both the promise and limitations of these approaches.

Memory impairment is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with 
amnesia often appearing as its earliest symptom. Given the multifactorial nature 
of AD pathogenesis, this study investigates the multi-target therapeutic 
potential of sobrerol (coded as NRM-331) in a scopolamine-induced amnesia mouse 
model, focusing specifically on its effects in ameliorating memory deficits and 
enhancing neuronal plasticity. Sixty male C57BL/6NCrljOri mice were divided into 
six groups (10 mice/group): vehicle control (CTL, saline), scopolamine (SPA, 10 
mg/kg/day), Aricept (APT, 2 mg/kg/day), and three treatment groups receiving 
NRM-331 at doses of 40, 80, and 100 mg/kg/day. Several behavioral tests were 
conducted, including the Y-maze test, passive avoidance test, and Morris water 
maze test. Additionally, biochemical assays were performed in serum (to measure 
Aß 1-40 and Aß 1-42) and in the brain (to assess ACh and AChE levels), along 
with histopathological examination of the brain using Nissl staining and p-tau 
IHC. No significant change was observed in the Y-maze test or the acquisition 
trial of the passive avoidance test. However, improvements were noted in the 
retention trial of the passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze test 
(including escape latency, swim distance, and number of platform crossed) for 
the NRM-331 groups compared to the SPA group. Serum levels of Aß 1-40 and Aß 
1-42 decreased in the NRM-331 groups compared to the SPA group. In the brain, 
levels of ACh significantly increased, while AChE levels significantly decreased 
compared to the SPA group. The number of neuronal cells improved in the CA1, 
CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus, as indicated by Nissl staining. A 
significant reduction in p-tau accumulation was also observed in the NRM-331 
groups. In conclusion, NRM-331 demonstrated an anti-amnesic effect by enhancing 
hippocampal cholinergic signaling, alongside exhibiting anti-tau and anti-Aβ 
synthesis properties. These therapeutic effects suggest that NRM-331 
significantly mitigates memory impairment induced by SPA through a 
neuroprotective mechanism.

The piperazine derivative 
N-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)propanamide (cmp2) has emerged 
as a potential transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 
6 (TRPC6) modulator, offering a promising pathway for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
therapy. Our recent findings identify cmp2 as a novel compound with 
synaptoprotective effects in primary hippocampal cultures and effective 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. In vivo studies demonstrate that cmp2 (10 
mg/kg, intraperitoneally) restores synaptic plasticity deficits in 5xFAD mice. 
This study further shows cmp2's selectivity towards tetrameric TRPC6 channel in 
silico. Acute administration of cmp2 is non-toxic, with no indications of 
chronic toxicity, and Ames testing confirms its lack of mutagenicity. Behavioral 
assays reveal that cmp2 improves cognitive functions in 5xFAD mice, including 
increased novel object recognition, better passing of the Morris water maze, and 
improved fear memory, as well as upregulation of motor function in beam walking 
tests. These findings suggest that cmp2 holds promise as a candidate for AD 
treatment.

Neurotrophic and Neurotoxic Effects of Aβ42 and Its Oligomers on Neuronal 
Survival: Revealed by Their Opposite Influence on the Potency of Extracellular 
BDNF.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for neuronal survival. 
Amyloid-β monomers (Aβ42M) and oligomers (Aβ42O) have trophic and toxic effects 
on neuronal survival, respectively. Branched oligosaccharides (BOs) and 
catechins (CAs) can specifically bind to Aβ42M/Aβ42O, influencing both effects. 
However, whether and how Aβ42M/Aβ42O influences BDNF remains unknown. This study 
investigated the interaction between Aβ42M/Aβ42O and BDNF, the effects of Aβ42M 
and Aβ42O on BDNF binding to the TrkB/p75 receptor and their impact on 
BDNF-supported cell survival, and the roles of BOs and CAs in these processes. 
BDNF exhibited stronger binding affinity for Aβ42M and Aβ42O than BOs/CAs. Aβ42M 
increased neuronal viability by synergistically enhancing BDNF binding to TrkB 
and p75, whereas Aβ42O decreased neuronal viability by inactivating/consuming 
BDNF, thereby reducing its binding to these receptors. BDNF-Aβ42O binding 
appeared to mutually neutralize/counteract each other's biological effects; 
therefore, increasing BDNF levels might reduce Aβ42O's neurotoxicity. By 
competitively targeting Aβ42M/Aβ42O rather than BDNF or its receptors, BOs and 
CAs enhanced these effects. These findings suggest that Aβ42M's neurotrophicity 
was directly linked to its synergistic enhancement of BDNF activity, whereas 
Aβ42O's neurotoxicity was primarily due to its inactivation or consumption of 
BDNF. This study provided valuable insights for developing BOs/CAs-based 
neuroprotective therapeutics or nanomaterials against AD.

Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative condition that significantly affects cognitive, emotional, and 
functional abilities in older adults. This study aimed to explore how 
demographic, clinical, and psychological factors influence the progression of 
cognitive decline in patients diagnosed with AD. Materials and Methods: A total 
of 101 patients were evaluated retrospectively and followed longitudinally at 
three different time points, using standardized instruments, including the MMSE, 
Reisberg's GDS, clock-drawing test, MADRS, and Hamilton depression scale. 
Statistical methods included non-parametric tests, mixed-effect modeling, and 
Bayesian analysis. Results: Most patients were older women from rural areas, 
predominantly in moderate-to-severe stages of AD. Age showed a significant 
association with cognitive decline (p < 0.05), and depression-particularly in 
moderate and severe forms-was strongly linked to lower MMSE scores (p < 0.001). 
Over 70% of the participants had some degree of depression. The clock-drawing 
test highlighted visuospatial impairments, consistent with everyday functional 
loss. Although donepezil and memantine combinations appeared to be more 
frequently prescribed, no treatment showed a statistically significant 
advantage, and confidence interval overlaps suggest caution in interpreting 
differences between therapies. Longitudinal models confirmed a progressive and 
accelerated decline, with inter-individual variability becoming more pronounced 
in later stages. Although comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, were 
frequent, they did not show a statistically significant effect on MMSE scores in 
this cohort. Conclusions: Age and depression appear to play central roles in the 
pace of cognitive deterioration in AD. Given the limited efficacy of most 
current therapies, these findings highlight the need for earlier intervention 
and a more personalized, integrated approach-combining cognitive care, 
psychiatric support, and comorbidity management-to better meet the needs of 
patients with AD.

John's, NL A1C 5S7, Canada.

Background: Late-onset depression (LOD) has been increasingly recognized as a 
risk factor for dementia, yet the temporal and causal nature of this 
relationship remains unclear. Objective: The purpose of this review is to 
investigate the temporal association between LOD and dementia. Methods: A 
comprehensive search for studies examining the temporal relationship between LOD 
and dementia was conducted using MEDLINE via Ovid. The end date of the search 
was 9 September 2024. A total of 3450 studies were identified, of which 27 met 
the inclusion criteria. This review was conducted in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines and an article quality assessment was completed. Results: The review 
demonstrated a significant temporal association between LOD and the risk of 
dementia, with the highest risk observed within the first decade following 
depression onset. LOD was consistently associated with an increased likelihood 
of developing dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, compared to depression 
at earlier life stages. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the 
significant association between LOD and dementia risk, emphasizing the need for 
early recognition and intervention. Future research should investigate the age 
at which LOD becomes a risk factor for dementia, the relationship between 
depression severity, family history of dementia, and dementia risk, as well as 
the efficacy of preventative treatments.

Telepresence robots can enhance social connection and support person-centered 
care in long-term care (LTC) homes. This study evaluates their impact in 
facilitating virtual visits between family caregivers and older residents in 
Canadian LTC homes. Telepresence robots were placed in residents' rooms, 
allowing virtual visits at mutual convenience. A total of 18 residents and 17 
family caregivers participated. Quantitative assessments included the Zarit 
Burden Interview, the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, and the Quality of Life 
in Alzheimer's Disease scale, while qualitative data were collected through 
interviews, field notes, and observations. Repeated ANOVA showed that using 
telepresence robots significantly reduced caregiver burden (p = 0.008), improved 
residents' quality of life (p = 0.028), and decreased resident loneliness (p = 
0.038). Older caregivers experienced the greatest burden reduction, with scores 
dropping from a mean of 25.0 at baseline to 16.1 at two months. Qualitative 
findings provided further context, revealing that residents felt more connected, 
close, and engaged, while families found the robots facilitated continuity of 
care, complemented in-person visits, reduced stress and guilt, and provided 
reassurance. These findings suggest that telepresence robots can enhance the 
well-being of both residents and caregivers in LTC homes, though future research 
should explore their long-term impact and technological limitations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant global health challenge with 
limited FDA-approved treatments, necessitating the search for novel preventive 
strategies. Antioxidants that are present in fruits and vegetables have garnered 
attention due to their potential neuroprotective effects. Among these, 
pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) has emerged as a promising source of 
neuroprotective antioxidants as it is rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and 
hydrolysable tannins. Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) is a source of bioactive 
compounds that may modulate key pathological processes of AD. This study 
investigated the therapeutic potential of PSO in murine neuroblastoma N2a cells 
treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate AD-like inflammation. The 
effects of PSO on inflammation and oxidative stress markers, including TNF-α, 
iNOS, SOD1, and IL1β, were evaluated, along with changes in AD-related 
biomarkers Aβ42, Aβ40, and p-tau181. Additionally, the study extended its 
findings to clinical settings by assessing the impact of supervised PSO 
consumption for 12 months on similar biomarkers in patients with mild cognitive 
impairment. Results from this integrative approach demonstrated the 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of PSO, supporting its role in 
modulating AD-associated pathophysiology. These findings suggest that PSO may 
serve as an early-stage intervention to delay or mitigate AD progression, 
highlighting its therapeutic potential in preclinical and clinical contexts.

Interplay Between Vascular Dysfunction and Neurodegenerative Pathology: New 
Insights into Molecular Mechanisms and Management.

Vascular dysfunction frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disorders such 
as dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older individuals; however, the 
cause-and-effect relationship remains unclear. While AD is primarily 
characterized by neural tissue degeneration, emerging evidence suggests that 
aging-induced vascular dysfunction contributes to both the onset and progression 
of cognitive impairment and dementia by decreasing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and 
disrupting the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This challenges the traditional notion 
and underscores vascular dysfunction as an early pathogenic stimulus; thus, 
targeting vascular pathologies could be a promising strategy to slow dementia 
progression and potentially prevent AD. Conversely, aging-related 
neurodegeneration exacerbates vascular dysfunction, accelerating dementia 
pathology through oxidative stress and inflammation as well as deposition of 
neurotoxic substances such as beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau in vascular walls. This 
bidirectional interaction creates a vicious cycle that worsens cognitive 
decline, underscoring the complexity of these diseases. This review aims to 
highlight recent advances in research on the mechanisms of aging-related 
vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on vascular 
contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and AD. Additionally, 
we will explore the reciprocal effects and intricate relationship between 
vascular dysfunction and neurodegenerative pathologies, enhancing our 
understanding of relative disease pathogenesis and guiding the development of 
innovative prevention and treatment strategies.

Cholesterol sulfate (CS) is a naturally occurring cholesterol derivative that is 
widely distributed across various tissues and body fluids. In humans, its 
biosynthesis is primarily mediated by the sulfotransferase (SULT) 2B1b 
(SULT2B1b). Over the years, CS has been found to play critical roles in various 
physiological processes, including epidermal cell adhesion, sperm capacitation, 
platelet adhesion, coagulation, glucolipid metabolism, bone metabolism, gut 
microbiota metabolism, neurosteroid biosynthesis, T-cell receptor signaling, and 
immune cell migration. In this review, we first introduce the endogenous 
regulation of CS biosynthesis and metabolism. We then highlight current advances 
in the understanding of the physiological roles of CS. Finally, we delve into 
the implications of CS in various diseases, with a particular focus on its 
mechanism of action and potential therapeutic applications. A comprehensive 
understanding of CS's physiological function, biosynthesis regulation, and role 
as a disease modifier offers novel insights that could pave the way for 
innovative therapeutic strategies targeting a wide range of conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, 
poses significant humanistic and economic burdens worldwide. Previously, we 
identified Trp-Leu-Pro (WLP), a novel antioxidant peptide derived from the sea 
squirt (Halocynthia roretzi); however, its effects on AD remained unexplored. In 
this study, we developed a rapid and efficient method to generate AD cerebral 
organoids with consistent quality using okadaic acid (OKA) exposure. This study 
aimed to evaluate the protective effects of WLP on OKA-induced AD pathology in 
cerebral organoids and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Our results 
demonstrated that cerebral organoids exposed to 25 nM OKA successfully 
recapitulated hallmark AD pathologies, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque 
deposits, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau 
proteins, and neuronal loss. WLP treatment significantly enhanced cell 
viability, increased the proportion of neuronal progenitor cells, and reduced Aβ 
plaques and NFTs in OKA-induced cerebral organoids. Furthermore, transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that the neuroprotective effects of WLP are primarily mediated 
through the regulation of synapse-related and oxidative stress pathways. These 
findings highlight the potential of WLP as a promising nutraceutical candidate 
for AD prevention.

Background: Current treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ), have limitations with 
regard to their efficacy and safety, posing significant challenges for advances 
in healthcare. However, recent studies indicated that AD can be treated using 
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Reportedly, the protein CD300c regulates 
monocyte differentiation, indicating that targeting CD300c could offer a 
treatment for AD. Methods: To confirm this, we developed CB201, a fully human 
anti-CD300c antibody, and demonstrated its strong and specific binding to CD300c 
using surface plasmon resonance and binding ELISAs. Results: Treatment of THP-1 
and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with CB201 led to increased levels 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the differentiation of macrophages to MDMs. 
Moreover, the CB201-differentiated macrophages expressed cytokines and 
chemokines in a pattern that alleviates AD symptoms. In a 5xFAD mouse model, 
CB201 treatment improved memory and behavior in both the early and late stages 
of AD and reduced cerebral Aβ plaque load. Conclusions: These results indicate 
that CB201 promotes the differentiation of macrophages to MDMs and modulates 
AD-related inflammatory responses, thereby ameliorating the pathological 
features of AD. These findings identify CD300c as a potential therapeutic target 
for AD and indicate that CB201 is a promising candidate for its treatment.

Minor visual phenomena (MVP), such as visual illusions, pareidolias, feeling of 
presence, and passage hallucinations, are often experienced by patients with 
Lewy Body Disease (LBD), in addition to complex visual hallucinations (VH), even 
in the early stages of the disease. This systematic review aimed to provide an 
up-to-date literature review of the occurrence and prevalence of MVP in LBD and 
to assess their potential associations both with VH and visuoperceptual and 
visuospatial deficits. A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, 
Web of Science, APA PsycInfo, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, and a total of 44 
articles were included. The included studies showed significant variability in 
the occurrence of MVP in the LBD population and in the assessment methods used, 
such as standardized scales (e.g., the noise pareidolia test), semi-structured 
interviews (e.g., the North-East Visual Hallucinations Interview), and clinical 
descriptions. Similarly to VH, MVP appears to be highly specific to LBD, helping 
in differential diagnosis from Alzheimer's Disease. The overall relationship 
between MVP, VH, and visuoperceptual/visuospatial deficits remains unclear. Some 
studies found that MVP (especially pareidolic responses and presence of 
hallucinations) was positively correlated with VH, yet it is challenging to 
determine whether MVP can be considered a precursor of future VH development. 
Negative associations were reported between MVP (especially pareidolias) and 
visuoperceptual/visuospatial abilities. However, it is not clear whether these 
deficits serve as independent, exclusive factors in MVP occurrence or if they 
interact with VH as a contributing component. Gaining insight into the 
occurrence of these phenomena could prove beneficial for differential diagnosis, 
prognosis, and prediction of treatment outcomes in patients with LBD.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a pivotal role in determining 
protein fate, regulating signal transduction, and maintaining cellular 
homeostasis. Protein ubiquitination, a key post-translational modification, is 
orchestrated by the sequential actions of three primary enzymes, 
ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and 
ubiquitin protein ligase (E3), alongside the regulatory influence of 
deubiquitinases (DUBs) and various cofactors. The process begins with E1, which 
activates ubiquitin molecules. Subsequently, E2 receives the activated ubiquitin 
from E1 and transfers it to E3. E3, in turn, recognizes specific target proteins 
and facilitates the covalent attachment of ubiquitin from E2 to lysine residues 
on the target protein. Among the E2 enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2O 
(UBE2O) stands out as a unique E2-E3 hybrid enzyme. UBE2O directly mediates the 
ubiquitination of a wide array of substrates, including 5'-AMP-activated protein 
kinase catalytic subunit alpha-2 (AMPKα2), MAX interactor 1 (Mxi1), and v-maf 
musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (c-Maf), among others. In this 
narrative review, we will explore the structural characteristics of UBE2O and 
elucidate its molecular functions. Additionally, we will summarize recent 
advancements in understanding the role of UBE2O in various tumors, Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and metabolic diseases. Finally, we will discuss the potential of 
targeting UBE2O as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human 
diseases.

Background/Objectives: Previous studies have shown that adiponectin deficiency 
or blocking adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) in the brain can lead to an 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology. While AdipoRs are abundantly 
expressed in peripheral tissues, the effects of blocking these receptors in the 
peripheral tissues on the brain are unclear. This study investigates the impacts 
of blocking AdipoRs with a peripheral administration of ADP400, an antagonist 
peptide that targets AdipoRs on cognitive performance, hippocampal adult 
neurogenesis, and AD-like neuropathology in mice. Methods: Adult mice were 
intraperitoneally administered with ADP400 peptide that blocks peripheral 
AdipoRs continuously for 21 days, followed by a battery of behavioral test for 
mood and memory performance. Results: ADP400-treated mice exhibited impaired 
memory performance and increased anxiety-like behaviors. Molecular analyses 
revealed heightened hyperphosphorylation of tau and increased β-amyloid levels, 
alongside decreased expression of AdipoRs and PP2A in the hippocampus, 
suggesting a critical role of AdipoRs in AD-like neuropathology. Furthermore, 
ADP400 treatment significantly reduced hippocampal adult neurogenesis, as 
indicated by decreased BrdU, Ki67, and DCX staining. Inhibiting peripheral 
adiponectin receptors could lead to tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulated 
β-amyloid levels. Conclusions: These findings highlight the critical role of 
peripheral manipulation of adiponectin receptors in modulating cognitive 
function and adult neurogenesis, offering insights into potential therapeutic 
strategies for AD and related cognitive disorders.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In 
addition to cognitive decline, non-cognitive symptoms, including dysautonomia, 
have been reported, although these symptoms are rarely acknowledged by patients. 
Dysautonomia in AD is thought to arise from either cholinergic deficits or 
hypothalamic involvement. A wide range of tests has been used to investigate the 
role of the autonomic nervous system; however, the results have been 
inconsistent. Aim: To systematically review all published research investigating 
autonomic nervous system (ANS) involvement in patients with AD. A comprehensive 
literature search was conducted in December 2024 across the following databases: 
PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. Results: A total of 1422 
records were identified, of which 30 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria 
and were included in the review. Several autonomic tests were employed, with 
Heart Rate Variability (HRV) being the most frequently used. Other tests 
included assessments of orthostatic hypotension (OH), postprandial hypotension 
(PPH), sympathetic skin response (SSR), the tilt test, 123I-MIBG cardiac 
scintigraphy, norepinephrine (NE) measurements in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, 
and baroreflex sensitivity. In most studies, AD patients were compared to either 
healthy controls or patients with other types of dementia. Discussion: The 
primary finding of this review is that, although patients with AD rarely report 
dysautonomic symptoms, they frequently exhibit abnormal results on various 
autonomic tests. In some cases, these findings were sufficient to differentiate 
AD patients from healthy controls as well as from patients with Diffuse Lewy 
Body disease (DLB). The inconsistency in reporting symptoms, along with the 
variability in test results, suggests that autonomic dysfunction in AD may be 
under-recognized and warrants further investigation. Conclusions: The 
heterogeneity of the included studies limits the generalizability of the 
results. However, given the potential impact of dysautonomia on both quality of 
life and mortality, it is recommended that AD patients be systematically 
assessed for autonomic dysfunction. Even in the absence of overt symptoms, 
appropriate treatment should be considered where indicated to mitigate potential 
risks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and chronic neuroinflammation. Growing 
evidence highlights neuroinflammation-driven by microglial activation and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine release-as a key contributor to AD pathogenesis and 
progression. In the absence of effective disease-modifying therapies, attention 
has turned to natural compounds with multi-target potential. Flavonoids, a 
diverse class of plant-derived polyphenols, have demonstrated neuroprotective 
properties through antioxidant activity, modulation of neuroinflammatory 
pathways, and interference with both Aβ aggregation and tau pathology. This 
narrative review provides an integrative overview of current findings on the 
mechanisms of action of key flavonoids-such as quercetin, luteolin, and 
apigenin-in both preclinical and clinical models. Emphasis is placed on their 
effects on microglial polarization, oxidative stress reduction, mitochondrial 
support, and synaptic function enhancement. Moreover, flavonoids show 
synergistic potential when combined with standard pharmacotherapies, such as 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and may offer broader cognitive benefits in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these promising findings, 
significant challenges persist, including poor bioavailability, inter-individual 
variability, and limited long-term clinical data. This review identifies 
critical gaps in knowledge and outlines future directions, including targeted 
drug delivery systems, biomarker-guided personalization, and long-duration 
trials. Flavonoids thus emerge not only as promising neuroprotective agents but 
also as complementary candidates in the development of future multi-modal 
strategies for AD treatment.

BackgroundHeadache is a common symptom following mild traumatic brain injury 
(mTBI). Post-traumatic headache (PTH), a secondary headache disorder that 
develops after mTBI, often persists for months or years. To identify potential 
recovery mechanisms and prognostic biomarkers, the present study investigated 
whether longitudinal changes in pain-induced brain activation differ between 
healthy controls (HC) and PTH participants showing headache improvement and 
those without improvement.MethodsThirty-three participants who met International 
Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, criteria for acute PTH within 
59 days post-mTBI and 33 HC participants were included with no significant 
differences in demographics. All participants underwent functional magnetic 
resonance imaging scans at baseline, four weeks, and 16 weeks post-enrollment 
using a thermal stimulation paradigm with noxious and non-painful heat stimuli. 
'Painful vs. Non-Painful Heat' contrasts were generated using SPM12. PTH 
improvement was assessed at three months post-enrollment via electronic headache 
diaries. Two-sample t-tests compared the brain activation between HC and PTH at 
baseline. Linear mixed-effects models examined longitudinal changes for HC, PTH 
improvement and non-improvement groups across visits. Generalized linear models 
compared these groups within visits.ResultsBaseline analysis revealed several 
regions with significantly higher activation in acute PTH compared to HC, 
including bilateral postcentral gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right 
middle temporal gyrus, left inferior parietal gyrus, right superior parietal 
gyrus, left ventral striatum, left olfactory cortex, left gyrus rectus, and left 
middle occipital gyrus. Over time, the PTH improvement group demonstrated 
progressive normalization across all identified brain regions, whereas the 
non-improvement group showed only partial normalization in left ventral 
striatum, left olfactory cortex, and left gyrus rectus. Sustained elevated 
activation in specific regions distinguished PTH participants without headache 
improvement from those with headache improvement, suggesting potential 
biomarkers for persistent PTH.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate significantly 
altered pain-induced brain activations in participants with acute PTH compared 
to HC. Longitudinal analysis revealed distinct recovery trajectories: 
progressive normalization in the improvement group versus persistent alterations 
in the non-improvement group. These neuroimaging patterns may serve as 
biomarkers for identifying individuals at risk for persistent PTH, with 
implications for early intervention and personalized treatment approaches.

BACKGROUND: Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by cleaving Tau at residue N368, accelerating its 
hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. The Tau N368/t-Tau ratio in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) serves as a superior biomarker compared to established biomarkers 
(p-Tau 181/217) for correlating with tau pathology and synaptic dysfunction in 
patients with AD, highlighting its diagnostic and therapeutic potential.
METHODS: We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a Tau N368-specific antibody 
in two mouse models: Tau P301S (tauopathy) and 3xTg (AD with Aβ/tau pathology). 
We conducted chronic intraperitoneal administration of the antibody to evaluate 
its effects on tau aggregation, synaptic integrity, and cognitive function. 
Neuropathological changes, synaptic plasticity (through electrophysiology), and 
behavioral outcomes were analyzed alongside Aβ pathology and neuroinflammation 
in 3xTg mice.
RESULTS: Treatment with the anti-Tau N368 antibody significantly diminished 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed of hyperphosphorylated/truncated Tau in 
both models. Clearance of Tau restored BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling, 
improved synaptic plasticity, and alleviated cognitive deficits. In 3xTg mice, 
this treatment also reduced Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation, resulting in 
enhanced learning and memory. Notably, the antibody's effectiveness in 
alleviating both tau and Aβ pathologies indicates a potential interaction 
between these pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting Tau N368 through immunotherapy alleviates tau-driven 
neurodegeneration, restores synaptic function, and improves accompanying Aβ 
pathology in AD models. Our results confirmed that Tau N368 is an exceptional 
biomarker and a promising therapeutic target, disrupting AD progression by 
addressing tau aggregation and its downstream effects.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are prevalent 
neurodegenerative disorders and strongly affect both the patients' lives and 
their caregivers. Strategy to improve and restore mitochondrial function, as 
well as to treat mitochondria-associated diseases, as observed in the 
pathophysiology of AD and PD. The current study aimed to investigate the 
potential of mitotherapy in AD and PD in preclinical studies.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of articles in English related to 
mitotherapy in AD and PD animal models published until October 2024 in the 
selected bibliographic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google 
Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant review articles published. The 
quality of the final selected studies was assessed using the Collaborative 
Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Studies (CAMARADES) checklists 
and the SYRCLE risk of bias tool. The initial search resulted in 231 studies, 
and after screening the titles and abstracts, 30 studies were recognized. 
Finally, 7 studies met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Despite restricted knowledge of the mitotherapy mechanisms, evidence 
shows that exogenous mitochondria exert neuroprotective effects via improving 
mitochondrial function, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in 
preclinical models of AD and PD.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review summarizes the preclinical studies on 
mitotherapy and provides evidence favoring mitochondria transplantation's 
protective effects in animal PD and AD models.

Sleep disturbances are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and primary tauopathies. Here we 
demonstrate that administration of the dual orexin receptor antagonist 
lemborexant in the P301S/E4 mouse model of tauopathy improves tau-associated 
impairments in sleep-wake behavior. It also protects against chronic reactive 
microgliosis and brain atrophy in male P301S/E4 mice by preventing abnormal 
phosphorylation of tau. These neuroprotective effects in males were not observed 
after administration of the nonorexinergic drug zolpidem that similarly promoted 
nonrapid eye movement sleep. Furthermore, both genetic ablation of orexin 
receptor 2 and lemborexant treatment reduced wakefulness and decreased seeding 
and spreading of phosphorylated tau in the brain of wild-type mice. These 
findings raise the therapeutic potential of targeting sleep by orexin receptor 
antagonism to prevent abnormal tau phosphorylation and limit tau-induced damage.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia. It is linked 
with a gradual decline in various brain functions, such as memory. Many research 
efforts are now directed toward non-invasive procedures for early diagnosis 
because early detection greatly benefits the patient care and treatment outcome. 
Additional to an accurate diagnosis and reduction of the rate of misdiagnosis; 
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems are built to give definitive diagnosis. This 
paper presents a novel CAD system to determine stages of AD. Initially, deep 
learning techniques are utilized to extract features from the AD brain MRIs. 
Then, the extracted features are reduced using a proposed feature reduction 
technique named Deep Downsized Kernel Partial Least Squares (DDKPLS). The 
proposed approach selects a reduced number of samples from the initial 
information matrix. The samples chosen give rise to a new data matrix further 
processed by KPLS to deal with the high dimensionality. The reduced feature 
space is finally classified using ELM. The implementation is named DDKPLS-ELM. 
Reference tests have been performed on the Kaggle MRI dataset, which exhibit the 
efficacy of the DDKPLS-based classifier; it achieves accuracy up to 95.4% and an 
F1 score of 95.1%.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Gene therapy 
that augments intrinsic neuroprotective pathways offers a promising strategy to 
mitigate neurodegeneration and prevent further cognitive loss. Caveolin-1 
(Cav-1), a membrane lipid raft (MLR) scaffolding protein, regulates multiple 
pro-growth and pro-survival signaling pathways within plasmalemmal microdomains. 
Previously, we showed that AAV9-Synapsin-promoted Cav-1 (SynCav1) delivered to 
presymptomatic AD mice preserved cognitive functions and MLR-associated 
neurotrophic signaling. However, the therapeutic potential of SynCav1 delivered 
at the symptomatic stage of AD had not been tested. Therefore, the current study 
investigated the effect of hippocampal SynCav1 delivery at symptomatic age in 
two distinct preclinical AD models of amyloid pathology: PSAPP and APPKI mice. 
Our results demonstrated that SynCav1 delivery to PSAPP and APPKI mice at 
symptomatic age consistently preserved hippocampal-dependent memory. 
Transcriptome profiling revealed that PSAPP-SynCav1 mice exhibited a similar 
transcript profile to age-matched wild-type mice. Gene Ontology enrichment 
analysis indicated downregulation of neurodegeneration-specific pathways and 
upregulation of synaptic and cognitive-related pathways in PSAPP-SynCav1 mice. 
In vitro, SynCav1-transfected mouse primary cortical neurons exhibited increased 
p-CaMKII and p-CREB expression, suggesting that SynCav1 may protect the CNS by 
enhancing neuronal and synaptic activity. Furthermore, activity-dependent 
neuroprotective protein (ADNP) was identified as a potential candidate mediating 
SynCav1's neuroprotective effects on cognition. Subcellular membrane 
fractionation revealed that SynCav1 preserved MLR-localized pituitary adenylate 
cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1R), a well-known regulator 
of ADNP expression. Together, these findings highlight SynCav1 as a unique and 
promising gene therapy candidate in the treatment of AD.

The emerging class of bispecific antibodies represents a significant advancement 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) immunotherapy by addressing the limited brain 
concentrations achieved with conventional monoclonal antibodies. The majority of 
bispecific antibodies developed for AD treatment utilize transferrin receptor 
(TfR1)-mediated transcytosis to enhance blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, 
resulting in higher and more uniform brain concentrations compared to 
conventional antibodies. This improved delivery has demonstrated superior 
efficacy in reducing brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) burden. Additionally, TfR1-mediated 
delivery may help mitigate adverse effects such as amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities (ARIA). This is likely achieved by a reduction in antibody 
accumulation at vascular Aβ deposits, resulting from the combined effects of 
lower dosing and a different brain entry route when using bispecific antibodies. 
Besides targeting Aβ, bispecific antibodies have been engineered to address 
other key pathological features of AD, including tau pathology and 
neuroinflammatory targets, which are critical drivers of disease progression. 
These antibodies also show promise in diagnostic applications, particularly as 
radioligands for antibody-based positron emission tomography (immunoPET), 
leveraging their rapid brain delivery and efficient and specific target 
engagement. Moreover, the principles of bispecific antibody technology have been 
adapted for use beyond immunotherapy. The incorporation of TfR1-binding domains 
into enzymes, antisense oligonucleotides, or viral vectors such as 
adeno-associated viruses broadens their therapeutic potential. These approaches 
may enable more efficient treatment strategies, not only for AD but also for 
other neurological disorders, by facilitating the delivery of diverse 
therapeutic agents across the BBB.

In recent years, the study of microorganisms and the brain has become 
increasingly connected. The gut-brain-microbiome axis (GBMA), a bi-directional 
communication system, is the key part of how the body's bacteria and the brain 
interact. This system can influence the brain and behaviour. Changes in this 
relationship have been linked to various mental and physical health conditions. 
The immune system, tryptophan metabolism, the vagus nerve, and the enteric 
nervous system all facilitate connections between the gut and brain. Microbes 
produce Peptidoglycans, branched-chain amino acids, and short-chain fatty acids, 
which are involved in this communication. Studies suggest the gut microbiome may 
be involved in conditions like autism, anxiety, obesity, schizophrenia, 
Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers are exploring the 
gut-brain connection to cure a variety of disorders, such as neurological 
disorders, cancers, metabolic problems, and liver diseases. Developing novel 
drug delivery systems is a key focus in GBMA for therapeutic targeting at 
various disease pathways. Notable platforms attracting significant interest 
include silica nanoparticle-based delivery systems for probiotic spores, 
composite hydrogels formulated from protein isolates and citrus pectin, and 
biomimetic nanosystems designed for targeted therapeutic delivery. This review 
summarizes different methods of delivering drugs and using dietary interventions 
to target the GBMA and treat these conditions in a less invasive way. By 
understanding how the gut and brain communicate, scientists aim to develop new 
and more effective therapies for these complex chronic diseases.

Galanthamine, an isoquinoline alkaloid used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's 
disease, is predominantly extracted from Amaryllidaceae plants, yet its supply 
remains limited. In this study, we identified, isolated, and characterized 
N-methyltransferases (NMTs) from three galanthamine-producing species: Leucojum 
aestivum, Lycoris radiata, and Hippeastrum papilio. The transcriptomic analysis 
identified five unique NMT isoforms, among which LaLrHpNMT1, an isoform highly 
conserved across all three species, exhibited the highest catalytic activity. 
Phylogenetic and structural analyses revealed that these enzymes share high 
sequence conservation and maintain the class I methyltransferase Rossmann fold 
with key catalytic residues, paralleling known NMTs from benzylisoquinoline 
alkaloid pathways. Flexible docking simulations confirmed that norgalanthamine, 
a crucial precursor, fits within the enzyme's active site and interacts with 
conserved residues Glu204 and His208. In vitro and in planta assays demonstrated 
that LaLrHpNMT1 efficiently catalyzes the N-methylation of norgalanthamine to 
galanthamine. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the key role of Glu204 and the 
participation of Phe residues in substrate stabilization. Additional enzyme 
assays revealed that LaLrHpNMT1 is promiscuous towards various alkaloid 
intermediates, while subcellular localization using eGFP-tagged constructs 
exposed a dual distribution in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting 
that NMT activity occurs at the cytosol-ER interface where other biosynthetic 
enzymes reside. Environmental stress experiments in H. papilio shoots culture 
showed significant upregulation of NMT expression under heat and other stress 
conditions associated with AA levels modulation, indicating a potential link 
between stress responses and alkaloid biosynthesis. These findings deepen our 
understanding of galanthamine biosynthesis and provide a foundation for 
metabolic engineering strategies aimed at improving production yields.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of cognitive decline in the earliest stages of Alzheimer 
disease (AD) is important but challenging. AD is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by gradual cognitive decline. Disease stages range from 
preclinical AD, in which individuals are cognitively unimpaired, to mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Digital technologies promise to enable 
detection of early, subtle cognitive changes. Although the field of digital 
cognitive biomarkers is rapidly evolving, a comprehensive overview of the 
reporting of psychometric properties (ie, validity, reliability, responsiveness, 
and clinical meaningfulness) is missing. Insight into the extent to which these 
properties are evaluated is needed to identify the validation steps toward 
implementation.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to identify the reporting on quality 
characteristics of smartphone- and tablet-based cognitive tools with potential 
for remote administration in individuals with preclinical AD or MCI. We focused 
on both psychometric properties and practical tool characteristics.
METHODS: This scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews) guidelines. In total, 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and 
PsycINFO) were systematically searched from January 1, 2008, to January 5, 2023. 
Studies were included that assessed the psychometric properties of cognitive 
smartphone- or tablet-based tools with potential for remote administration in 
individuals with preclinical AD or MCI. In total, 2 reviewers independently 
screened titles and abstracts in ASReview, a screening tool that combines manual 
and automatic screening using an active learning algorithm. Thereafter, we 
manually screened full texts in the web application Rayyan. For each included 
study, 2 reviewers independently explored the reported information on practical 
and psychometric properties. For each psychometric property, examples were 
provided narratively.
RESULTS: In total, 11,300 deduplicated studies were identified in the search. 
After screening, 50 studies describing 37 different digital tools were included 
in this review. Average administration time was 13.8 (SD 10.1; range 1-32) 
minutes, but for 38% (14/37) of the tools, this was not described. Most tools 
(31/37, 84%) were examined in 1 language. The investigated populations were 
mainly individuals with MCI (34/37, 92%), and fewer tools were examined in 
individuals with preclinical AD (8/37, 22%). For almost all tools (36/37, 97%), 
construct validity was assessed through evaluation of clinical or biological 
associations or relevant group differences. For a small number of tools, 
information on structural validity (3/37, 8%), test-retest reliability (12/37, 
32%), responsiveness (6/37, 16%), or clinical meaningfulness (0%) was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous smartphone- and tablet-based tools to assess cognition in 
early AD are being developed, whereas studies concerning their psychometric 
properties are limited. Often, initial validation steps have been taken, yet 
further validation and careful selection of psychometrically valid outcome 
scores are required to demonstrate clinical usefulness with regard to the 
context of use, which is essential for implementation.

BACKGROUND: Curcuma longa L. (CL) is renowned for its various health benefits 
and has shown potential in alleviating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
post-aqueous extraction residues (CLR) may retain valuable nutritional 
components. The research aimed to explore their chemical composition and 
neuroprotective mechanism against Aβ1-42-induced AD mice.
METHODS: We employed UPLC-Q-Exactive/MS to characterize the chemical 
constituents of CL and CLR. An HPLC method was developed to quantify three 
predominant curcuminoids. To investigate their neuroprotective effects against 
Aβ1-42-induced AD mice, we assessed cognitive function using the Morris water 
maze and evaluated neuronal damage through histopathological examination. 
Molecular mechanisms were explored using immunofluorescence, ELISA, and qRT-PCR 
assays.
RESULTS: The study unveiled 47 and 36 compounds in CL and CLR, respectively, and 
eight significant differential components. HPLC analysis revealed that CLR 
contained substantial curcuminoids. In Aβ1-42-induced AD mice, CL and CLR 
improved spatial learning and memory ability, ameliorated pathological 
alterations in the hippocampal region, and regulated overactivated microglia. 
Moreover, CL and CLR inhibited the TLR4/NF-κB inﬂammatory pathway.
CONCLUSION: CL and CLR exhibit the anti-AD effect by regulating microglia and 
suppressing the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, which provides a scientific basis 
for future nutraceutical and pharmaceutical development.

CONTEXT: The amyloid hypothesis is the most widely accepted explanation for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Failure of microglia Amyloid β-protein (1-42) (Aβ1-42) 
oligomer clearance and secondary neuroinflammation play a crucial role in the 
etiology in sporadic AD. Piper kadsura (Choisy) Ohwi (PkO), an herb of Chinese 
medicine, has anti-inflammation, antioxidation effects.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of PkO and its active substances on Alzheimer's 
disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrated drug prediction, network pharmacology and 
molecular docking techniques to systematically examine multi-scale mechanisms of 
PkO. Moreover, human Microglia Clone 3 (HMC3) were respectively incubated for 24 
hours in the presence or absence of Syk inhibitor (SI, 100 nmol/L), β-amyloid 
(1-42) oligomer mixtures (called as Aβ oligomer hereafter, Aβ, 2.5 µM), or 
hancinone (HAN, 0.5 µM, 2.5 µM, 10 µM) to verify the target of the effect of PkO 
on Aβ oligomer-induced microglia.
RESULTS: Ultimately, we screened hancinone from PkO as a potential therapeutic 
agent for AD. Hancinone increased Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 
2 (TREM2), Syk, and p-Syk levels, up-regulated relative levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT, 
and mTOR, promoted the ability of HMC3 cells from the M1 phenotype to the M2 
phenotype in Aβ or SI-stimulated HMC3 cells, and enhanced the phagocytic 
capacity of HMC3 cells to Aβ.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Hancinone could regulate the phenotype of HMC3 cells 
and promote cell phagocytosis of Aβ by modulating the TREM2/Syk/PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling pathway. This systematic exploration indicates that hancinone has the 
therapeutic effect on AD.

Oxidative stress (OS) plays a central role in age-related cognitive decline and 
neurodegeneration and is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Elevated 
OS biomarkers are detectable from the earliest stages of these disorders. In 
this critical narrative review, we explore the bioenergetic cascade underlying 
neurodegeneration, emphasizing pathophysiological alterations, mechanisms, and 
therapeutic targets. Recent evidence suggests that OS and impaired cellular 
energy dynamics are both early markers and downstream effects of 
neuroinflammation, contributing to symptom severity and reduced treatment 
efficacy. A deeper understanding of these interrelated processes is essential 
for the development of more effective interventions. Monitoring OS-related 
metabolites may offer a promising strategy for identifying therapeutic targets 
and enabling early clinical intervention, ultimately aiming to reduce 
neuroinflammation and improve patient outcomes in AD and PD.

IMPORTANCE: The adverse social exposome, the entirety of harmful lifetime 
social-environmental exposures, is associated with Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) risk and may be key to informing modifiable systemic and 
behavioral risk interventions. With increasing emphasis to understand lifetime 
risk, methods are needed to measure and study social exposome relative to 
ADRD-related biological processes, including cerebrovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between adverse social exposome and the 
burden of vascular brain injury (VBI) post mortem.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 
brain bank donors from 2 Alzheimer Disease Research Centers. Donations occurred 
between January 5, 2000, and August 5, 2018. Analysis was performed between 
January 13 and July 20, 2023.
EXPOSURES: Adverse social exposome, via geo-linked, time-concordant Area 
Deprivation Index (ADI) rankings for each year of a donor's lifetime.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome consisted of the presence or 
absence of VBI indicators: infarcts, microinfarcts, hemorrhages, and white 
matter rarefaction. Association between cumulative or change in life-course ADI 
and VBI burden was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models 
adjusted for sex and age at death.
RESULTS: The sample included 740 donors (417 female [56.4%]; mean [SD] age at 
death, 81.5 [10.3] years; mean [SD] VBI score, 0.7 [1.0]; and median life course 
ADI, 7.08 [IQR, 4.33-9.83]), with residential years spanning 1905 to 2018. In 
adjusted models, living more years in a county with an ADI ranked above the 
study population median was associated with increased VBI odds (adjusted odds 
ratio [AOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05). Greater odds of VBI were identified in 
those with increasing ADI between youth and adulthood (AOR, 3.67; 95% CI, 
3.65-3.70) and youth and older adulthood (AOR, 12.02; 95% CI, 7.87-18.35). 
Increased odds were found in groups with stable high median ADI from youth to 
adulthood (AOR, 3.08; 95% CI, 3.01-3.14) and youth to older adulthood (AOR, 
8.46; 95% CI, 8.04-8.90).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 740 brain bank donors, an 
association between ADI and the presence of VBI was indicated, when considering 
the full life course as well as specific life course periods. These results show 
promise for identifying geographic areas in need of targeted interventions to 
reduce cerebrovascular disease and ADRD risk factors.

IMPORTANCE: Recent research suggests a plausible biological link between autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) and Parkinson disease (PD). Nonetheless, large 
longitudinal studies examining the risk of PD following ASD are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between ASD and future PD risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide population-based prospective 
cohort study was performed using data from Swedish national registers. All 
individuals born in Sweden from 1974 to 1999 with follow-up from age 20 years 
until December 31, 2022, and with complete covariate data were included. The 
analysis was completed in August 2024.
EXPOSURES: Diagnoses of ASD as a time-varying exposure obtained from the 
National Patient Register.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnoses of PD were obtained from the National 
Patient Register through 2022. The relative risk (RR) of PD was quantified using 
incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs from Poisson regression. Preterm birth, 
depression, antidepressant use, and antipsychotic exposure over time were 
potentially modifying life events.
RESULTS: The study included 2 278 565 individuals (median [IQR] age at exit, 34 
[29-42] years; 1 106 772 female [48.6%]), contributing 33 858 476 person-years. 
PD occurred in 438 of 2 226 611 individuals without ASD (0.02%; 1.3 
cases/100 000 person-years) and 24 of 51 954 individuals with ASD (0.05%; 3.9 
cases/100 000 person-years) (RR, 4.43 [95% CI, 2.92-6.72]). The risk estimates 
were similar after adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, family history of 
mental illness, family history of PD, and age at ASD diagnosis. Preterm or 
early-term birth was not associated with and did not modify the PD risk. 
Depression and antidepressant use (present in 24 257 individuals with ASD 
[46.7%]) were associated with increased risk of PD (RR, 2.01 [95% CI, 
1.40-2.88]), independent of ASD. Antipsychotic exposure (present in 16 387 
individuals with ASD [31.5%]) reduced but did not fully attenuate the 
association (RR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.27-3.14]) and showed no interaction with ASD on 
PD risk.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: ASD was associated with increased risk of PD, even 
after adjusting for depression or antidepressant use and antipsychotic exposure. 
These findings suggest a potential shared etiology between neurodevelopmental 
disorders and PD, and a heightened awareness of long-term neurological 
conditions in individuals with ASD may be warranted.

Gut Fungi in Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms, Biomarkers and Therapeutic 
Potential.

Liu Z, Chen Z, Zhang X, Ge Y, Yuan D, Zhai H.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of aging 
that imposes a heavy medical and socioeconomic burden. Its multifactorial 
pathology-including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, tauopathy, and chronic 
neuroinflammation-lacks effective disease-modifying treatments. Recent studies 
highlight the gut-brain axis, specifically the intestinal mycobiome (fungal 
community), as a novel factor in AD. In this review, we summarize evidence on 
gut fungi in AD. Altered gut fungal profiles have been reported in AD patients, 
including enrichment of Candida tropicalis and Schizophyllum commune and 
reduction of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and in AD mouse models, such as increased 
abundance of the Dipodascaceae family. Fungi can translocate or release 
bioactive molecules that impact the brain; for instance, fungal proteins 
(enolase, β-tubulin) and polysaccharides (chitin) have been detected in AD brain 
tissue. Fungal metabolites also emerge as potential biomarkers; notably, plasma 
sterigmatocystin levels were significantly higher in AD patients compared to 
controls. Mechanistically, gut fungi (such as Candida or Malassezia species) may 
activate microglia and promote Aβ deposition via inflammatory pathways, while 
fungal prion-like proteins can accelerate AD protein aggregation in vitro. 
Conversely, certain fungi exert neuroprotective effects; oral administration of 
the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii attenuated cognitive deficits and Aβ 
pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, fecal fungal profiling is non-invasive 
and may serve as a practical AD screening tool. Collectively, these findings 
nominate gut fungi as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future work 
should validate specific mycobiome signatures and develop fungus-targeted 
interventions to enable earlier diagnosis and novel treatments for AD.

Targeting brain inflammation has been proposed as a promising therapeutic 
strategy to cope with neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, accumulating 
data suggest that the gut microbiota partially exerts its neurodegenerative 
effects by exacerbating neuroinflammation through increased pathogenic or 
unhealthy genera that releases different types of cytokines in the periphery. 
Recently, soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme (sEH) emerged as a new 
pharmacological approach for treating Alzheimer's Disease. Treatment with a sEH 
inhibitor (UB-BJ-02) modified the gut microbiota in the 5xFAD mouse model, 
increasing health-promoting genera such as Lactobacillus and 
Limosilactobacillus. By contrast, pro-inflammatory genera (e.g., Bacteroides) 
were decreased. UB-BJ-02 treatment enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory 
peripheral mediators in the colon and spleen, such as Il-10. 5xFAD mice treated 
with UB-BJ-02 showed improved short- and long-term memory and spatial memory 
compared to 5xFAD control. Furthermore, we found a reduction in 
neuroinflammatory markers evaluated by immunohistochemical assays, such as GFAP 
and IBA-1, and gene expression, such as Il-1β, Tnf-a, Il-6, and Trem2, in the 
brain of 5xFAD-treated mice and a significant decrease in the number of Aβ 
plaques. T Treatment decreased DRP1 protein levels while increasing OPA1 levels, 
resulting in improved mitochondrial function corroborated by the elevation of 
Pgc1-α. Interestingly, a correlation between UB-BJ-02 brain effects and 
microbiota changes were demonstrated. To validate this correlation, we fed 
CL4176 AD transgenic strain, with Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Bacteroides 
rodentium. Consequently, we observed that changes in feeding modified the number 
of Aβ plaques and neuroinflammatory markers in C. elegans. Therefore, the 
present study suggested that sEH inhibition with UB-BJ-02 promoted 
neuroprotective effects, modulating gut microbiota and modifying peripheral and 
brain pro-inflammatory markers.

Background/Objectives: Several genetic factors are related to the risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the response to cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) 
(donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) or memantine. However, findings have 
been controversial, and, to the best of our knowledge, admixed populations have 
not been previously evaluated. We aimed to determine the impact of genetic and 
non-genetic factors on the risk of AD and the short-term response to ChEIs and 
memantine in patients with AD from Mexico. Methods: This study included 117 
patients from two specialty hospitals in Mexico City, Mexico. We evaluated 
cognitive performance via clinical evaluations and neuropsychological tests. 
Nineteen variants in ABCB1, ACHE, APOE, BCHE, CHAT, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, CHRNA7, 
NR1I2, and POR were assessed through TaqMan assays or PCR. Results: Minor 
alleles of the ABCB1 rs1045642, ACHE rs17884589, and CHAT rs2177370 and 
rs3793790 variants were associated with the risk of AD; meanwhile, CHRNA7 
rs6494223 and CYP3A5 rs776746 were identified as low-risk variants in AD. BCHE 
rs1803274 was associated with worse cognitive functioning. None of the genetic 
and non-genetic factors studied were associated with the response to 
pharmacological treatment. Conclusions: We identified potential genetic variants 
related to the risk of AD; meanwhile, no factor was observed to impact the 
response to pharmacological therapy in patients with AD from Mexico.

The electroencephalography (EEG)-based approach provides a promising low-cost 
and non-invasive approach to the early detection of pathological cognitive 
decline. However, current studies predominantly utilize EEGs from resting state 
(rsEEG) or task-state (task EEG), posing challenges to classification 
performances due to the unconstrainted nature of mind wandering during resting 
state or the inherent inter-participant variability from task execution. To 
address these limitations, this study proposes a novel feature extraction 
framework, working memory task-induced EEG response (WM-TIER), which adjusts 
task EEG features by rsEEG features and leverages the often-overlooked 
inter-state changes of EEGs. We recorded EEGs from 21 AD individuals, 24 MCI 
individuals, and 27 healthy controls (HC) during both resting and working memory 
task conditions. We then compared the classification performance of WM-TIER to 
the conventional rsEEG or task EEG framework. For each framework, three feature 
types were examined: relative power, spectral coherence, and filter-bank phase 
lag index (FB-PLI). Our results indicated that FB-PLI-based WM-TIER features 
provide (1) better AD/MCI versus HC classification accuracy than rsEEG and task 
EEG frameworks and (2) high accuracy for three-class classification of AD vs. 
MCI vs. HC. These findings suggest that the EEG-based rest-to-task state 
transition can be an effective neural marker for the early detection of 
pathological cognitive decline.

Neurological disorders represent a major global health concern owing to their 
intricate pathological processes. Ferroptosis, defined as a form of cell death 
that is reliant on iron, has been closely linked to various neurological 
conditions. The fundamental process underlying ferroptosis is defined by the 
excessive buildup of iron ions, which initiates lipid peroxidation processes 
leading to cellular demise. Neurons, as highly metabolically active cells, are 
susceptible to oxidative stress, and imbalances in iron metabolism can directly 
initiate the ferroptosis process. In neurodegenerative disorders like 
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, ferroptosis driven by iron 
accumulation represents a fundamental pathological connection. Although the 
connection between ferroptosis and neurological diseases is clear, clinical 
application still faces challenges, such as precise regulation of iron 
metabolism, development of specific drugs, and assessment of efficacy. The 
limited comprehension of the ferroptosis mechanism hinders the development of 
personalized treatment approaches. Consequently, subsequent investigations must 
tackle these obstacles to facilitate the clinical application of 
ferroptosis-associated therapies in neurological disorders. This article 
provides a comprehensive overview of the most recent advancements regarding the 
underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis. Subsequently, the study investigates the 
mechanistic contributions of ferroptosis within the nervous system. In 
conclusion, we evaluate and deliberate on targeted therapeutic strategies 
associated with ferroptosis and neurological disorders.

Mitochondrial autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that eliminates 
dysfunctional mitochondria to maintain cellular homeostasis. Among 
receptor-dependent mitophagy pathways, FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1)-a 
mitochondrial outer membrane protein harboring an LC3-interacting region 
(LIR)-plays a central role by directly binding to LC3 under stress conditions, 
thereby initiating autophagosome encapsulation of damaged organelles. Emerging 
evidence implicates FUNDC1 dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases, 
particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), where defective mitophagy exacerbates 
hallmark pathologies including Aβ plaque deposition and hyperphosphorylated 
Tau-driven neurofibrillary tangles. Despite advances, the molecular interplay 
between FUNDC1 phosphorylation states (e.g., Ser13/Ser17/Tyr18) and AD 
progression remains poorly defined. This review systematically examines FUNDC1's 
dual regulatory role in mitophagy, its mechanistic links to Aβ and Tau 
pathologies, and the therapeutic potential of targeting FUNDC1-associated 
kinases (e.g., ULK1, CK2) or downstream effectors (e.g., DRP1, OPA1) to 
counteract mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. By synthesizing recent preclinical 
and clinical findings, we aim to bridge the gap between FUNDC1 biology and AD 
therapeutics, highlighting actionable nodes for drug development.

BackgroundIntestinal bacteria-derived molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) produced by Gram-negative bacteria, can translocate into the bloodstream 
through the gut wall, contributing to inflammation and neurodegeneration via 
oxidative stress mechanisms. NADPH oxidase-2 activation and superoxide anion 
production play a key role in this process, particularly in conditions like 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), where gut permeability is often altered. This study 
hypothesized that modulating gut microbiota with the probiotic Escherichia coli 
Nissle 1917 (ECN) could mitigate LPS translocation and its associated 
inflammatory effects.ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of daily ECN administration 
on serum LPS levels in elderly AD patients.MethodsA randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 40 mild AD patients, with 39 
completing the study (20 ECN, 19 placebo). Participants received ECN 
(2.5-25 × 10^9 CFU/capsule) or placebo for six weeks. The serum activity of 
soluble NOX2-dp (sNOX2-dp), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α levels and LPS was evaluated, while serum zonulin levels were 
measured to assess gut permeability.ResultsThe ECN group showed significant 
reductions in sNOX2-dp (-21%), H2O2 (-27%), TNF-α (-18%), LPS (-15%), and 
zonulin (-35%), along with improved Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. 
No significant changes were seen in the placebo group. Mixed ANOVA showed 
significant time-by-treatment interactions for zonulin (p = 0.04) and MMSE 
(p < 0.001). Changes in LPS correlated with changes in zonulin (Rs = 0.408, 
p = 0.011).ConclusionsECN may strengthen gut barrier function, reduce 
endotoxemia, and attenuate inflammation in AD, though larger studies are needed 
to confirm these findings.

BackgroundYoung-onset dementia (YOD) presents distinct health and care needs due 
to its earlier onset compared to late-onset dementia (LOD). Understanding these 
challenges is crucial for developing tailored interventions.ObjectiveThis 
systematic review describes and analyzes the supportive care needs of 
individuals with YOD and identifies key areas for further research.MethodsA 
qualitative systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with 
comprehensive searches of databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Web of 
Science, etc. Screening and data extraction were performed, followed by a 
"Best-fit" framework synthesis. Study quality was appraised using the JBI 
Critical Appraisal Tool, and confidence in the findings was assessed using the 
ConQual approach.ResultsSeventeen articles yielded 42 findings categorized into 
17 groups and synthesized into three themes: (1) needs for empowerment through 
knowledge, planning, and meaningful engagement, (2) needs for promoting physical 
health, mental support, and social engagement, and (3) needs for a comprehensive 
support network. Theme 1 encompassed six sub-themes: accurate and timely 
diagnosis, pre-determined care plan, desire for disease-related knowledge, 
autonomy in decision-making and dignity preservation, future planning, and a 
sense of self-worth. Theme 2 involved physical activity, symptom management, 
psychotherapy, social and recreational activities, employment, and public 
awareness. Theme 3 comprised financial and family responsibilities, caregiver 
support, professional support, information support, and caregiving 
institutions.ConclusionsIndividuals with YOD remain an under-researched group 
with unique needs. This review highlights their specific needs and experiences, 
emphasizes the importance of tailored support, and informs the development of 
targeted future interventions.Registration numberCRD42024514037.

BackgroundHigh cardiorespiratory fitness has been associated with greater 
neuroplasticity, and slower neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in healthy 
adults. Yet, less is known about whether low-to-intermediate cardiorespiratory 
fitness is associated with lower markers of disease progression in the 
preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD).ObjectiveWe investigated whether 
cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with plasma biomarkers for AD-related 
pathology, neural injury and astrocyte reactivity, and episodic memory in 
Presenilin-1 E280A carriers without dementia from the world's largest kindred 
with autosomal-dominant AD.MethodsTwenty-seven mutation carriers (25 cognitively 
unimpaired, 2 with mild cognitive impairment; ages: μ=30.22 years, SD = 5.24; 
74% female) participated in the study. Participants underwent a graded aerobic 
fitness test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness, measured in maximum metabolic 
equivalent of task (MET). Plasma biomarkers included amyloid 42/40, 
phosphorylated tau-181, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic 
protein. Participants completed the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD 
word list learning and delayed recall. We conducted multiple linear regressions 
controlling for age, sex, and years of education.ResultsFourteen participants' 
MET values were indicative of low cardiorespiratory fitness (<9 MET), and 13 
participants' MET values of intermediate cardiorespiratory fitness (9-14 MET). 
METs were not associated with age, biomarkers, or episodic memory.ConclusionsOur 
findings suggest that low-to-intermediate cardiorespiratory fitness may not be 
associated with biomarkers for AD-related pathology, neural injury and astrocyte 
reactivity, or memory in people at genetic risk for dementia. Longitudinal 
studies and randomized-controlled trials are needed to better understand the 
relationships among cardiorespiratory fitness and AD progression.

BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be effective 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI); however, the 
therapeutic efficacy varies significantly, highlighting the need for reliable 
biomarkers to predict treatment response. While rTMS may activates cortical 
white matter, the relationship between induced electric field (E-field) in this 
region and clinical outcomes remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study characterized 
the E-field in cortical gray matter (EFgm), cortical white matter (EFwm), and 
region-of-interest (EFROI) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 
and explored their correlations with treatment efficacy in patients with MCI due 
to AD.MethodsThirty patients with MCI due to AD received 2-week rTMS treatment, 
with efficacy measured by Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and a 
comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Responders were defined as those with 
>25% improvement in AVLT-immediate memory. Correlations between regional brain 
volumes and E-field magnitudes, and the correlations between E-field magnitudes 
and cognitive improvement, were analyzed. Predictive performance of E-fields for 
responder classification was evaluated.ResultsPronounced inter-individual 
variability in magnitudes of EFgm, EFwm and EFROI was observed, partially 
explained by differences in regional brain volumes of DLPFC targeted area. 
Treatment responders exhibited significantly higher EFwm magnitude. EFwm 
positively correlated with AVLT-immediate memory improvement (R2 = 0.37) and 
predicted responder groups, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.76.ConclusionsE-field within cortical white matter in the DLPFC correlates 
with rTMS efficacy and predicts therapeutic response in MCI due to AD. 
Personalized stimulation protocols incorporating EFwm modeling may optimize 
treatment parameters.Trial registrationThis study is registered in the Chinese

Currently, the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is limited to symptomatic 
therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, which contribute to 
a temporary improvement in cognitive functions and increased independence in 
everyday life but have little effect on the progression rate of the 
neurodegenerative process. The purpose of the review is to analyze current 
studies of pathogenetic (disease-modifying therapy) of AD. According to modern 
concepts, AD pathogenesis is associated with the accumulation of amyloid 
protein, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, etc. The most promising pathogenetic therapy is currently 
considered anti-amyloid antibodies, anti-tau therapies, and antidiabetic and 
anti-inflammatory therapy. Anti-amyloid therapies such as aducanumab, lecanumab, 
and donanemab have recently been officially approved for practical use in some 
countries around the world. Therapeutic strategies for tau protein-related 
disorders, neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, and other neurodegeneration 
mechanisms are also being actively studied. Along with drug therapy, noninvasive 
brain stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
transcranial electrical stimulation, which have a high safety profile and proven 
effectiveness, are actively developing.

Publisher: В настоящее время лечение болезни Альцгеймера (БА) сводится к 
симптоматической терапии ингибиторами ацетилхолинэстеразы и мемантином, которые 
способствуют временному улучшению когнитивных функций и повышению 
самостоятельности в повседневной жизни, но мало влияют на темпы прогрессирования 
нейродегенеративного процесса. Цель обзора — анализ современных исследований 
патогенетической (болезнь-модифицирующей терапии) БА. По современным 
представлениям, патогенез БА связан с накоплением амилоидного белка, 
гиперфосфорилированием тау-протеина, нейровоспалением, митохондриальной 
дисфункцией и др. Наиболее перспективными средствами патогенетической терапии в 
настоящее время считаются антиамилоидные антитела, лекарственные средства для 
анти-тау терапии, антидиабетическая и противовоспалительная терапия. Препараты 
для антиамилоидной терапии, такие как адукунумаб, леканумаб и донанемаб, были 
недавно официально одобрены для практического применения в некоторых странах 
мира. Также активно изучаются терапевтические стратегии воздействия на патологию 
тау-протеина, нейровоспаление, инсулинорезистентность и другие механизмы 
нейродегенерации. Наряду с лекарственной терапией, активно развиваются методы 
неинвазивной стимуляции головного мозга, такие как транскраниальная магнитная 
стимуляция и транскраниальная электростимуляция, обладающие высоким профилем 
безопасности и доказанной эффективностью.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the change of cognitive functioning for 15 years in 
non-treated first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
with symptoms of memory loss.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The observation cohort included 66 relatives of the 
first-degree relatives of patients with AD (Centre For Mental Health Research) 
with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), who agreed to a routine psychometric 
and in-depth neuropsychological examination and subsequent participation in the 
prolonged observation program but refused to use any drug therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An open-label 15-year observational study of the change 
of cognitive functioning in first-degree relatives of AD patients with symptoms 
of memory loss (SCD) was conducted. The baseline indicators of cognitive 
functioning of the study were compared with similar indicators after 5, 10, and 
15 years. For psychometric assessment, routine psychometric scales and tests 
were used (Mini-Mental State Examination; the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
Test; a Clock Drawing test, a scale of general deterioration; a test of random 
memorization of 10 words; the Boston naming test; subtest 6 of the Wechsler 
test; a test of memorizing 5 geometric shapes; the Benton test; the subtest 
sound and categorical associations, and the G. Münsterberg test.
RESULTS: A prospective study of a cohort of first-degree relatives of AD 
patients with symptoms of cognitive dysfunction showed a high risk of subsequent 
cognitive deterioration up to dementia. After 5 years of observation, 16.7% of 
subjects developed mild cognitive impairment (mci) syndrome. By year 10 of the 
study, mci syndrome was diagnosed in 42.4% of subjects, and in 7.6%, AD was 
diagnosed; in 50.0% of subjects, the initial condition did not worsen. By year 
15 of observation, 30.3% of patients were diagnosed with dementia in AD and 
34.85% with mci syndrome; in 34.85% of cases, the condition remained at the SCD 
level.
CONCLUSION: The results of a 15-year cognitive study in first-degree relatives 
of AD patients with SCD who did not receive prophylactic therapy showed a 
significant decrease in cognitive functioning parameters with a quite high 
conversion rate to MCI and/or to dementia in ad. Subsequent analysis of a 
complex of demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, and other risk factors for 
dementia due to ad contributes to determining the hereditary risk of SCD 
progression and developing personalized approaches to the prevention of dementia 
in individuals with a genetic risk of AD.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Оценить динамику когнитивного функционирования на 
протяжении 15 лет у родственников 1-й степени родства пациентов с болезнью 
Альцгеймера (БА), имевших субъективные жалобы на снижение памяти и не получавших 
медикаментозную терапию.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: В когорту наблюдения были включены 66 родственников 1-й 
степени родства пациентов с БА (лечившихся в ФГБНУ «Научный центр психического 
здоровья») с субъективным когнитивным снижением (Subjective Cognitive Decline, 
SCD), которые согласились на рутинное психометрическое и углубленное 
нейропсихологическое обследования и последующее участие в программе 
пролонгированного наблюдения, однако при этом отказались от применения 
каких-либо методов медикаментозного вмешательства.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Проведено открытое 15-летнее наблюдательное исследование 
когнитивного функционирования у родственников 1-й степени родства больных БА с 
субъективными жалобами на снижение памяти (SCD). Исходные показатели 
когнитивного функционирования сравнили с аналогичными показателями спустя 5, 10 
и 15 лет. Для психометрической оценки использовались краткий тест оценки 
когнитивных функций; Монреальская шкала оценки когнитивных функций; тест 
рисования часов, шкала общего ухудшения; тест произвольного запоминания 10 слов; 
Бостонский тест называния; субтест 6 теста Векслера; тест запоминания 5 
геометрических фигур; тест Бентона; субтест «Звуковые и категориальные 
ассоциации» и тест Г. Мюнстерберга.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Проспективное исследование когорты родственников 1-й степени родства 
пациентов с БА, имевших субъективные жалобы на когнитивные дисфункции, показало 
высокий риск последующего ухудшения в когнитивной сфере, вплоть до деменции. 
Через 5 лет катамнестического наблюдения у 16,7% пациентов сформировался синдром 
мягкого когнитивного снижения (MCI). К 10-му году исследования синдром MCI 
диагностирован уже в 42,4% случаев, а в 7,6% — был поставлен диагноз БА; в 50,0% 
— исходное состояние не ухудшилось. К 15-му году наблюдения 30,3% пациентов 
поставлен диагноз деменции при БА, 34,85% — синдром MCI; в 34,85% случаев 
состояние осталось на уровне SCD.
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Результаты 15-летнего исследования когнитивной сферы у родственников 
1-й степени родства больных БА с SCD не получавших профилактической терапии, 
показали значимое снижение параметров когнитивного функционирования с достаточно 
высоким показателем конверсии в MCI и/или в деменцию при БА. Последующий анализ 
комплекса демографических, клинических, нейропсихологических и других факторов 
риска развития деменции, обусловленной БА, позволит сформировать концепцию 
определения наследственного риска прогрессирования SCD и на этой основе 
разработать персонифицированные превентивные подходы к профилактике деменции у 
лиц с генетическим риском БА.

Cognitive disorders (CD) are a common problem in the practice of various medical 
specialities. Among the most common causes of severe CD (dementia) are 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular diseases. The stage of non-dementia 
CD precedes dementia. Interventions at the non-dementia stage are believed to be 
more effective, prolonging the patient's quality of life at a higher functional 
level with a decrease in the need for nursing care. Currently, there is a 
pronounced underdiagnosis of CD, especially AD, which reduces the timely 
availability of specific drug therapy for patients and adversely affects the 
prognosis of the disease. The article presents basic information on the 
pathogenesis and methods of clinical and paraclinical diagnosis of AD and CD of 
vascular origin. The main markers helping to distinguish these diseases and 
diagnose them at the predementia stage have been identified.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severely debilitating neurodegenerative disease 
with a rapidly increasing global prevalence, poorly understood causes, and no 
efficient treatments. Experimental models are valuable for studying AD 
pathogenesis, including amyloid beta and tau accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, 
and neuroinflammation. While no model fully reproduces the disease, we take an 
evolutionary biology approach to discuss available models across taxa, from 
mammals (rodents, primates) to zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, and 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Evaluating their strengths and limitations provides 
insight into disease mechanisms and may refine research strategies for improved 
diagnostics and therapeutic screening. Traditional models have significantly 
contributed to AD research, yet their translational limitations highlight the 
need for physiologically relevant alternatives. Integrating humanized rodent 
models, zebrafish, organoids, and induced pluripotent stem cell-based 
systems-along with advances in bioengineering and genetic editing-may offer a 
more comprehensive framework to bridge the gap between preclinical research and 
clinical application. HIGHLIGHTS: Experimental models across rodents, primates, 
zebrafish, fruit flies, and worms provide key insights into Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Cross-taxon comparisons assess strengths and weaknesses in AD models. 
Evolutionary biology approaches refine experimental strategies for AD research. 
Diverse animal models improve understanding of AD pathogenesis. Cross-species 
models enhance diagnostics and therapeutic strategy development.

INTRODUCTION: Crateva magna (Cm) was utilized as a folkloric medicine against 
neurological disorders.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the phytochemical profile of Cm leaf 
extract and its endophytic fungus, Nigrospora oryzae (No) extract. Additionally, 
the neuroprotective potential of their optimized bilosomes (BLs) will be 
assessed as an approach to Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-ESI-MS/MS chemical profiling was performed. In vitro 
anti-Alzheimer activity of Cm and No extracts was evaluated against AChE and 
BACE1 enzymes. Cm-BLs and No-BLs were prepared using the thin-film hydration 
technique. In vivo anti-Alzheimer potential was assessed in a streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced sporadic AD mouse model. Behavioral assays, neurochemical assays, 
RT-PCR analysis, histopathological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis 
were performed.
RESULTS: Chemical profiling revealed diverse metabolites from various chemical 
classes. The major class identified in Cm extract was flavonoids, e.g., 
kaempferol-O-hexoside, whereas in No extract, it was alkaloids, e.g., phenazine 
carboxamide. The neuropathological markers (Aβ1-42, IL-6, and p-Tau protein) 
were reduced by ≈50% and 60% in mice receiving Cm-BLs and No-BLs, respectively, 
relative to the STZ group. Also, the BLs exhibited the greatest ability to 
downregulate the expression of p-JNK, p-P38, and p-ERK in the brain. 
Histopathological examination revealed that No-BLs showed the highest protection 
for the hippocampus and cerebral cortex regions. Also, it revealed a 
significantly decreased reaction for NFκB in cerebral cortex neurons.
CONCLUSION: Cm-BLs and No-BLs exhibit considerable potential as novel adjuvant 
therapies for AD, utilizing natural bioactive compounds to improve the 
efficiency of targeted drug delivery and enhance therapeutic outcomes.

Microglia play a key role in the response to amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). In this context, the major transcriptional response of microglia is the 
upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three 
isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We 
hypothesised that the isoforms change gene regulatory patterns that link back to 
biological function by shaping microglial transcriptomic and chromatin 
landscapes. We use RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and 
chromatin accessibility of human microglia xenotransplantated into the brains of 
male APPNL-G-F mice. We identify widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic 
differences which are dependent on APOE genotype and are corroborated across the 
profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, 
migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for 
late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased phagocytic capabilities and 
DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the 
isoform's protective role.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. 
Targeting DKK3-mediated intestinal microbiota (IM) variation is a promising 
strategy to treat AD. Crocin can alter IM distribution and inhibit DKK3 
expression. We aimed to explore whether Crocin alleviates AD by regulating 
DKK3-mediated IM variation.
METHODS: AD animal models were established by injecting Aβ1-42 into the brains 
of rats. Subsequently, AD rats were overexpressed with DKK3 and treated with 
Crocin. Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests were performed to assess 
the learning and memory abilities of the rats. The effect of Crocin on brain 
Aβ1-42 and p-tau levels, serum proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) 
levels were analyzed. Then, hippocampal pathological damage of the rats was 
evaluated. Furthermore, DKK3, NeuN, Bax, BCL-2 expressions and GSK-3β 
phosphorylation were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. 
Moreover, rat feces were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Crocin improved learning and memory abilities of AD rats. Additionally, 
Crocin inhibited brain Aβ1-42 and p-tau levels, and serum proinflammatory 
cytokine levels for AD rats. It was also observed that Crocin attenuated 
hippocampal pathological damage, inhibited DKK3, Bax expressions and GSK-3β 
phosphorylation, but increased NeuN, BCL-2 expressions for AD rats. Notably, 
Crocin increased the α and β diversity of the IM in AD rats. However, DKK3 
overexpression reversed these situations. Additionally, Crocin treatment led to 
an increase in Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, alongside reductions in 
Lachnospiraceae UCG-001 and Family_XIII_AD3011_group.
CONCLUSION: Crocin alleviated AD by regulating DKK3-mediated IM variation, 
suggesting that DKK3-mediated IM variation was a potential therapeutic target 
for AD.

Sex Differences in Biofluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.

Aksnes M(1), Aksnes M(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Geriatric Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, 
Oslo, Norway.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, affects 
twice as many women as men. Moreover, sex is increasingly recognised as an 
important factor for AD, influencing symptom presentation, progression, disease 
biology, and treatment responses. In parallel, AD biomarkers are becoming more 
accessible with the discovery of specific and accurate blood-based biomarkers 
and their incorporation in AD diagnostic frameworks. This narrative review aimed 
to summarise sex differences in the concentration and interpretation of biofluid 
biomarkers for AD.
SUMMARY: Biological sex may influence both the concentration and interpretation 
of biofluid biomarkers for AD pathology such as amyloid-β aggregation, tau 
neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration, or neuroinflammation. While some 
biofluid biomarkers display consistent sex differences in absolute levels, most 
biomarker levels have not been found to differ consistently by sex. Nonetheless, 
even biomarkers that do not differ in absolute levels display sex-specific 
associations with clinically relevant variables such as brain atrophy, cognitive 
impairment, and disease progression.
KEY MESSAGE: Sex may influence the interpretation of AD biomarkers depending on 
their context of use, and more research is required to develop sex-specific 
guidelines. Future research should aim to study sex differences and sex-specific 
associations with variables of interest, as well as the underlying factors 
driving sex differences in AD.

In recent years, medical research has sparked hope that up to a third of 
dementia cases could be prevented. This optimism is driven by a shift in the 
understanding of dementia and, in particular, Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-from 
being a rapid-onset brain disease in later life to a condition strongly linked 
to lifestyle factors, progressing slowly and gradually through asymptomatic, 
pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic stages with varying degrees of severity. 
Accompanying this evolving perception, the use of mobile healthcare applications 
(mHealth apps) based on dementia prevention research has been on the rise. 
Health policymakers and companies increasingly advocate for these apps. However, 
concerns remain about the medical quality of such mHealth apps for dementia 
prevention. Bioethical research has highlighted significant challenges 
associated with their use. This paper critically examines dementia prevention 
strategies through the lenses of mHealth technologies. Exploring four mHealth 
apps for dementia prevention as case studies, we identify and analyze unsolved 
ethical issues related to primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Hereby we 
offer a new perspective on familiar ethical dilemmas in dementia prevention, and 
emphasize the need to examine potentially intensified challenges in the context 
of digital health in the future in more depth.

Necroptosis is a novel mode of cell death that differs from traditional 
apoptosis, characterized by distinct molecular mechanisms and physiopathological 
features. Recent research has increasingly underscored the pivotal role of 
necroptosis in various neurological diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer's 
disease and multiple sclerosis. A defining hallmark of these conditions is 
neuroinflammation, a complex inflammatory response that critically influences 
neuronal survival. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the 
mechanistic underpinnings of necroptosis and its intricate interplay with 
neuroinflammation, exploring the interrelationship between the two processes and 
their impact on neurological disorders. In addition, we discuss potential 
therapeutic strategies that target the intervention of necroptosis and 
neuroinflammation, offering novel avenues for intervention. By deepening our 
understanding of these interconnected processes, the development of more 
effective treatments approaches holds significant promise for improving patient 
outcomes in neurological disorders.

Acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including multiple sclerosis 
(MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), are characterized 
by neurodegeneration, which is the gradual malfunction and damage of neurons and 
axons in the central nervous system. Improved clinical diagnostic workups and 
the development and tracking of successful disease-modifying treatments are made 
possible by detecting appropriate neurodegenerative disease (ND) biomarkers. 
Important biomarkers, such as Tau proteins, amyloid-β, and α-synucleins, are 
essential for precise identification but are often evaluated using 
time-consuming, expensive, and traditional techniques like polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Due to its 
exceptional selectivity and sensitivity, electrochemical biosensing has become a 
popular, low-cost substitute for more conventional diagnostic methods. 
Nanoparticles in biosensors are particularly noteworthy because they improve 
electron transport and aid in immobilizing biorecognition components. Conducting 
polymers have shown great potential in the field of electrochemical sensing. 
Conducting polymers have shown great potential in electrochemical sensing. 
Additionally, research has shown that polypyrrole, polyaniline, 
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and poly(thiophene) are often regarded as 
among the best conducting polymers for fabricating electrochemical sensors. 
Moreover, a hydrogel biosensor allows for the detection of many parameters 
simultaneously with real-time monitoring, allowing for more accurate and timely 
tracking of multiple indicators of a patient. Hydrogel nano(bio)composite 
sensors that use electrochemical transduction methods to detect analytes are 
also available. Hydrogel-based polymer sensors for early-stage neurodegenerative 
diagnosis are examined in this review in a novel way. Afterward, we reviewed 
electrochemical sensors developed for detecting biomarkers related to diseases, 
including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. There 
have also been developments devised to enhance efficacy of electrochemical 
diagnostic tools to address their limitations. In this respect, we have also 
reviewed many polymers used in electrochemical diagnosis of neurological 
disorders. Finally, we have also evaluated the limits and prospects of clinical 
trials involving these electrochemical means of diagnoses.

Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multi-factorial type of dementia that 
poses a social and medical burden in that no effective treatment has been 
achieved yet. Impaired brain glucose metabolism is one of the major 
pathophysiological factors linked to its onset and progression. Lauric acid (LA) 
is a triglyceride with medium chain that can produce ketone body utilize by the 
brain as an alternative energy source.Objective: Therefore, the present study 
was carried out with the purpose of evaluating the effect of LA on cognitive 
impairments in scopolamine-induced AD-like rat model.Methods: Forty-two male 
Wistar rats were divided into six groups to receive normal saline, scopolamine, 
scopolamine with Donepezil, and scopolamine with varied doses of LA for a period 
of 21 days. Morris water maze (MWM) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) tests were 
performed to evaluate cognitive performance. After, brains were harvested and 
processed to assay for the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione 
(GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Histological analyses using Haematoxylin and eosin 
staining was also performed.Results: The LA-treated groups demonstrated memory 
retention in the MWM and EPM tests, and showed increased levels of CAT, SOD, and 
GSH similar to the Donepezil group, in contrast to the scopolamine only group 
while MDA levels, IL-6, and AChE activity were reduced in the LA treated groups 
contrasted to scopolamine only group. LA reduces oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, and AChE activity, which indicates a possible ability of LA 
to protect against AD.

We present and analyze an optimal control problem to model anti-inflammatory 
treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease, using a system of differential 
equations that captures interactions between A β -peptides, microglial cells, 
interleukins, and neurons. These interactions operate through mechanisms such as 
protein polymerization, inflammation processes, and neural stress responses. In 
particular, inflammation is highlighted as a key factor in the onset and 
progression of Alzheimer's disease, driven by a hysteresis effect related to the 
degradation rate d of monomers and the initial concentration of interleukins. 
This implies a critical inflammation threshold that determines whether the 
disease persists over the long term. The optimal control problem we propose 
seeks to minimize the concentration of toxic oligomers by modulating interleukin 
production and degradation rates, representing potential anti-inflammatory 
treatment effects. Under natural constraints on treatment dose efficacy and 
cumulative exposure, our goal is to assess whether it is possible to shift the 
system from a persistent disease state to a disease-free equilibrium. We provide 
the necessary conditions of the optimal solution and supplement our theoretical 
findings with numerical simulations, which illustrate the system's behavior 
under different parameter settings and the imposed constraints of the optimal 
control problem.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder, leading to significant cognitive decline and 
dementia. Oxytocin (OXT), a peptide hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus, has 
emerged as a critical player in cognitive functioning. Notably, alterations in 
OXT levels have been reported in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: This systematic review aims to synthesize existing literature from 
databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on the 
therapeutic potential of OXT in AD treatment. Two independent individuals 
conducted the screening procedure for all articles.
RESULTS: Our screening revealed that studies investigating OXT therapy primarily 
involve animal models. These studies consistently demonstrate that, OXT 
administration mitigates various memory deficits in animal models of AD. These 
improvements are linked to mechanisms such as reduced microglial-driven 
inflammation and decreased amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, but changes in plaque 
load do not always correspond directly to cognitive improvement.
DISCUSSION: While these findings are promising and oxytocin could be a potential 
therapeutic candidate for AD, the evidence is limited to animal studies. There 
is a lack of robust human data, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions 
about oxytocin's efficacy in people with AD. Ongoing and future clinical trials 
will be crucial to determine whether these preclinical benefits translate to 
humans.
CONCLUSION: Despite the limited number of studies examining the effects of OXT 
on AD and the inherent challenges in conducting such research, the available 
evidence from animal studies suggests promising results. These findings can 
serve as a valuable foundation for future human and complementary studies aimed 
at exploring oxytocin's therapeutic potential in treating AD.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms play a crucial role in the early and accurate 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is essential for effective 
treatment planning. However, existing methods are not well-suited for 
identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a critical transitional stage 
between normal aging and AD. This inadequacy is primarily due to label imbalance 
and bias from different sensitve attributes in MCI classification. To overcome 
these challenges, we have designed an end-to-end fairness-aware approach for 
label-imbalanced classification, tailored specifically for neuroimaging data. 
This method, built on the recently developed FACIMS framework, integrates into 
STREAMLINE, an automated ML environment. We evaluated our approach against nine 
other ML algorithms and found that it achieves comparable balanced accuracy to 
other methods while prioritizing fairness in classifications with five different 
sensitive attributes. This analysis contributes to the development of equitable 
and reliable ML diagnostics for MCI detection.

Characterizing differential responses to Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs will 
provide better insights into personalized treatment strategies. Our study aims 
to identify heterogeneous treatment effects and pre-treatment features that 
moderate the treatment effect of Galantamine, Bapineuzumab, and Semagacestat 
from completed trial data. The causal forest method can capture heterogeneity in 
treatment responses. We applied causal forest modeling to estimate the treatment 
effect and identify efficacy moderators in each trial. We found several 
patient's pretreatment conditions that determined treatment efficacy. For 
example, in Galantamine trials, whole brain volume (1092.54 vs. 1060.67 ml, P < 
.001) and right hippocampal volume (2.43e-3 vs. 2.79e-3, P < .001) are 
significantly different between responsive and non-responsive subgroups. 
Overall, our implementation of causal forests in AD clinical trials reveals the 
heterogeneous treatment effects and different moderators for AD drug responses, 
highlighting promising personalized treatment based on patient-specific 
characteristics in AD research and drug development.

The Alzheimer's disease (AD) scientific field continues to make significant 
advances in early detection and treatments, which importantly rest on advances 
in our fundamental understanding of AD pathobiology and its contribution to 
cognitive decline. Clinical readouts of monoclonal antibodies against various 
forms of the amyloid beta (Aβ) protein indicate that the impact of these 
treatments may extend beyond reduction in amyloid plaques. The Alzheimer's 
Association Research Roundtable meeting held on May 17 and 18, 2022, reviewed 
our understanding to date of the impact of treatments targeting various species 
of Aβ; its impact on other related pathophysiology including tau; and 
ultimately, its effects on neurodegeneration and clinical decline, driven by the 
latest available data. Participants discussed the current evidence for a causal 
relationship among amyloid accumulation, tau alteration, and cognitive decline; 
the effect of anti-amyloid therapies on clinical and biomarker endpoints; and 
how we can accelerate the pathway to therapeutic approval and what should guide 
us for the near future.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable convened leaders 
from industry and academia, as well as patients, clinicians, and government and 
regulatory agency scientists to discuss the topic "Current Understanding of AD 
Pathophysiology & Impact of Amyloid-beta Targeted Treatments on Biomarkers and 
Clinical Endpoints."The totality of scientific evidence (clinical trials, animal 
data, modeling, and observational studies) on the relationship between amyloid 
beta (Aβ), amyloid, tau, and cognitive impairment is helping our understanding 
of the downstream effects and overall importance of lowering amyloid plaque 
load.Based on data from multiple phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of anti-amyloid 
monoclonal antibodies, there is strong evidence to support that a sufficiently 
large reduction in amyloid plaque load to near-normal levels is associated with 
positive changes in tau biomarkers and clinical endpoints.Reduction of Aβ 
plaque, measured easily by plasma amyloid biomarkers, is reasonably likely to 
predict benefit in clinical outcome measures.

Music interventions show promise to support critical areas of decline for those 
living with dementia. There is a gap in identifying the skills and experiences 
necessary to facilitate the music activities in such an intervention. This pilot 
research creates an understanding of the characteristics and experiences of 
adolescent musicians who facilitated a digital, intergenerational music 
intervention. The research team conducted in-depth interviews with the 
adolescent participants and used descriptive phenomenological methodology. Eight 
adolescent musicians participated in the study, ranging from 14 to 18 years old. 
For characteristics, adolescents reported prior experience in music and key 
social supports. For experiences, adolescents reported decreased performance 
anxiety and increase in human connection and understanding of Alzheimer's 
disease and dementia. There is potential for researchers to explore if 
adolescents who facilitate such a music intervention experience less performance 
anxiety as well as more empathy for those living with dementia.

Depression, anxiety, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pose ongoing therapeutic challenges, particularly in aging populations. 
Conventional pharmacologic treatments often have delayed onset, limited 
efficacy, and unfavorable side effects, prompting interest in natural 
alternatives. Saffron (Crocus sativus L.), a spice long used in traditional 
medicine, has emerged as a promising candidate due to its multimodal 
neuroprotective properties. This review evaluated the clinical efficacy, safety, 
and mechanistic profile of saffron in the treatment of mood and cognitive 
disorders. A targeted literature search identified multiple double-blind 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses comparing saffron to 
standard pharmacologic agents or placebo. In depression, RCTs using 30 mg/day of 
saffron for six weeks showed comparable improvements in Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores to fluoxetine (20 mg/day), with significant 
reductions from baseline and no difference in adverse events. An adjunctive 
study using crocin (an active ingredient of saffron; 15 mg twice daily) also 
demonstrated additive effects alongside selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs). In cognitive disorders, saffron (30 mg/day) showed non-inferiority to 
donepezil (10 mg/day) and memantine (20 mg/day) in patients with 
mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe AD. Trials lasting 16 to 52 weeks 
demonstrated significant improvements on validated cognitive scales such as 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and 
Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), with fewer gastrointestinal 
side effects compared to standard treatments. Meta-analyses confirm the 
superiority of saffron over placebo and its equivalence to conventional drugs, 
with no serious adverse events. Saffron represents a safe, well-tolerated, and 
culturally integrated intervention with growing evidence for use in psychiatric 
and neurologic disorders. Larger, multicenter trials with biomarker validation 
and standardized extract formulations are needed to confirm its role in clinical 
practice.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming more prevalent among the elderly, 
with projections indicating that it will affect a significantly large population 
in the future. Regardless of substantial research efforts and investments 
focused on exploring the underlying biological factors, a definitive cure has 
yet to be discovered. The currently available treatments are only effective in 
slowing disease progression if it is identified in the early stages of the 
disease. Therefore, early diagnosis has become critical in treating AD.
APPROACH: Recently, the use of deep learning techniques has demonstrated 
remarkable improvement in enhancing the precision and speed of automatic AD 
diagnosis through medical image analysis. We propose a hybrid model that 
integrates a convolutional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) with a vision 
transformer (ViT). During the encoding phase, the CVAE captures key features 
from the MRI scans, whereas the decoding phase reduces irrelevant details in 
MRIs. These refined inputs enhance the ViT's ability to analyze complex patterns 
through its multihead attention mechanism.
RESULTS: The model was trained and evaluated using 14,000 structural MRI samples 
from the ADNI and SCAN databases. Compared with three benchmark methods and 
previous studies with Alzheimer's classification techniques, our approach 
achieved a significant improvement, with a test accuracy of 93.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Through this research, we identified the potential of the CVAE-ViT 
hybrid approach in detecting minor structural abnormalities related to AD. 
Integrating unsupervised feature extraction via CVAE can significantly enhance 
transformer-based models in distinguishing between stages of cognitive 
impairment, thereby identifying early indicators of AD.

Herein, we report the structure-activity relationship to develop novel tricyclic 
M4 positive allosteric modulator scaffolds with improved pharmacological 
properties. This endeavor involved modifying a 
5-amino-3,4-dimethylthieno[2,3-c]pyridazine-6-carboxamide core via a "tie-back" 
strategy to discover a novel tricyclic 
3,4-dimethylpyrimido[4',5':4,5]thieno[2,3-c]pyridazine core. From this exercise, 
VU6008055/AF98943 was identified as a preclinical candidate, which displays low 
nanomolar potency against both human and rat M4. Moreover, VU6008055 is highly 
brain penetrant, has an overall superior pharmacological and DMPK profile to 
previously reported M4 PAMs, and demonstrates efficacy in preclinical models of 
antipsychotic-like activity.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD), marked by progressive memory loss and 
cognitive decline, poses diagnostic challenges due to its multifactorial nature. 
Therefore, researchers are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence and 
data-driven approaches to develop computerized clinical decision support systems 
(CCDSS), aiming to enhance early detection, improve treatment, and slow disease 
progression.ObjectiveThis study seeks to conduct a systematic review of the most 
recently developed AD-CCDSS, delving into their progress and the challenges to 
guide future development and implementation of CCDSS for AD-related 
decision-making and intervention strategies.MethodsWe follow the PRISMA 2020 
guideline to search for articles published within the past seven years across 
PubMed, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science, and Scopus, 
with Google Scholar as a supplementary source. Key components are then extracted 
from the selected studies for qualitative analysis, including data modalities, 
computational modeling approaches, system explainability and interpretability, 
research priorities, and graphical user interfaces designed for non-technical 
stakeholders.ResultsAfter searching and removing duplicates, we meticulously 
selected 55 studies. After reviewing key components of CCDSS, we highlight 
advancements and potential clinical applications, demonstrating their promise in 
enhancing decision support. However, despite growing attention to explainability 
in AD-CCDSS, its clinical applicability remains limited. Moreover, challenges 
such as multi-center system interoperability and data security remain 
underexplored, hindering real-world implementation.ConclusionsThis study 
analyzes recent translational AD-CCDSS, identifying key challenges in advancing 
CCDSS for clinical applications. It offers insights for researchers to enhance 
CCDSS development and facilitate their integration into clinical practice.

BackgroundCognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) often includes speech 
impairments, where subtle changes may precede clinical dementia onset. As 
clinical trials focus on early identification of patients for disease-modifying 
treatments, digital speech-based assessments for scalable screening have become 
crucial.ObjectiveThis study aimed to validate a remote, speech-based digital 
cognitive assessment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection through the 
comparison with gold-standard paper-based neurocognitive 
assessments.MethodsWithin the PROSPECT-AD project, speech and clinical data were 
obtained from the German DELCODE and DESCRIBE cohorts, including 21 healthy 
controls (HC), 110 participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and 59 
with MCI. Spearman rank and partial correlations were computed between 
speech-based scores and clinical measures. Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed group 
differences. We trained machine learning models to classify diagnostic groups 
comparing classification accuracies between gold-standard assessment scores and 
a speech-based digital cognitive assessment composite score (SB-C).ResultsGlobal 
cognition, as measured by SB-C, significantly differed between diagnostic groups 
(H(2) = 30.93, p < 0.001). Speech-based scores were significantly correlated 
with global anchor scores (MMSE, CDR, PACC5). Speech-based composites for 
memory, executive function and processing speed were also correlated with 
respective domain-specific paper-based assessments. In logistic regression 
classification, the model combining SB-C and neuropsychological tests at 
baseline achieved a high discriminatory power in differentiating HC/SCD from MCI 
patients (Area Under the Curve = 0.86).ConclusionsOur findings support 
speech-based cognitive assessments as a promising avenue towards remote MCI 
screening, with implications for scalable screening in clinical trials and 
healthcare.

The NLRP3-P2X7 Axis and Cytokine Crosstalk in Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms, 
Implications, and Therapeutic Opportunities.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia in elderly 
individuals, characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and 
impaired daily functioning. Pathologically, AD is associated with the 
accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
and chronic neuroinflammation. The activation of the NOD-like receptor pyrin 
domain- containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome by Aβ clusters triggers microglial 
activation, leading to a cascade of inflammatory responses. Similarly, tau 
tangles stimulate neuronal and glial cells, further amplifying NLRP3 activation 
and perpetuating a cycle of chronic inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction 
exacerbates this process by increasing oxidative stress and inflammasome 
activation. Additionally, purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) activation in 
microglia plays a crucial role in initiating neuroinflammation, making it a 
potential therapeutic target. Despite extensive research, current AD therapies 
remain symptomatic rather than disease-modifying. Targeting the NLRP3 
inflammasome offers a promising strategy for mitigating AD progression. Various 
small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and repurposed drugs have been 
explored to inhibit NLRP3 activation and its downstream signaling pathways. 
Preclinical studies suggest that NLRP3 inhibitors effectively reduce Aβ- and 
tau-induced neuroinflammation while improving mitochondrial function and overall 
neuronal survival. This review summarizes NLRP3 inflammasome priming, 
activation, and the therapeutic potential of its inhibitors in AD, highlighting 
challenges such as tau pathology, biomarker limitations, and treatment 
optimization. While NLRP3 remains a promising target, most inhibitors are in the 
early stages with uncertain long-term efficacy and BBB penetration. Future 
research should explore genetic variability, sex differences, and alternative 
approaches to enhance neuroprotective strategies.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (rTMS) on cognitive recovery in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 
exploring the role of GABAergic neuron activation and modulation of the 
Cx3cl1-Cx3cr1 signalling axis. The 5xFAD mouse model was utilised for scRNA-seq 
analysis to examine changes in gene expression post-rTMS. Microglial phagocytic 
activity, amyloid plaque burden, cell-cell communication, microglial morphology 
and neuroinflammation markers were assessed. Following rTMS, upregulation of 
Cx3cl1 in GABAergic neurons was observed, leading to enhanced microglial 
phagocytosis, reduced amyloid plaque burden, improved cell-cell communication, 
altered microglial morphology and decreased neuroinflammation markers. This 
study demonstrates that rTMS promotes Aβ clearance and cognitive recovery in AD 
by activating GABAergic neurons and enhancing Cx3cl1-Cx3cr1 signalling, 
providing a novel molecular target for non-invasive AD therapy. These findings 
support the transition from invasive to non-invasive AD treatments, improving 
patient adherence and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the elucidation of 
cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitates drug development targeting the 
Cx3cl1-Cx3cr1 axis, offering new opportunities for AD intervention.

INTRODUCTION: We examined sex effects on amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET) in a large cohort of patients evaluated for cognitive complaints in a 
"real-world" specialty setting.
METHODS: We analyzed 10,361 amyloid PET scans (51% females) from the Imaging 
Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning Study. Amyloid positivity was defined by 
either local visual read or central PET processing and quantification (≥ 24.4 
Centiloids). Sex differences were examined using multilinear regression and 
logistic regression adjusted for age, comorbidities, and other demographic and 
clinical covariates.
RESULTS: Females had higher rates of positive amyloid PET visual reads (63% vs. 
59%, P < 0.001) and higher Centiloids (CLs; median 48.7 vs. 36.8, p < 0.001). On 
logistic regression, females had higher odds ratios (ORs) for positive amyloid 
PET (visual read OR 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.31; CL 
threshold-based OR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.26-1.49; both p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Females with cognitive impairment showed higher amyloid PET 
positivity and greater amyloid burden. Further research is needed to explore 
mechanisms and treatment implications.
HIGHLIGHTS: Females exhibited higher rates of amyloid positron emission 
tomography (PET) positivity and higher amyloid burden than males. These sex 
effects were found in patients with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
dementia. Females also had higher rates of dementia and amnestic MCI, while 
males had higher rates of non-amnestic MCI and more cholinesterase inhibitor 
use.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies have shown that antioxidants may be 
associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, some findings have 
failed to demonstrate a significant correlation. To rigorously evaluate this 
relationship, a comprehensive review and meta-analysis were conducted.
METHODS: All relevant cohort studies reporting association between antioxidants 
intake (diet and/or supplement use) and AD risk were searched in 9 electronic 
databases and 4 registration platforms from their inception up to March 15, 
2023. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated using either a fixed-effects or random-effects model. Heterogeneity 
was assessed using I2 statistics. Furthermore, a dose-response meta-analysis was 
conducted to explore potential dose-response relationships.
RESULTS: Eleven cohort studies were included. The pooled HRs of AD were 0.90 
(95% CI = 0.60-1.34) and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.75-1.17) for the dietary intake of 
vitamin E, 0.90 (95% CI = 0.76-1.07) for the vitamin E supplement use. The 
pooled HRs of AD were 0.84 (95% CI = 0.76-0.93) and 0.60 (95% CI = 0.35-1.02) 
for the dietary intake of vitamin C, 0.85 (95% CI = 0.72-1.00) for the vitamin C 
supplement use. The pooled HRs of AD were 1.02 (95% CI = 0.85-1.22) and 0.86 
(95% CI = 0.68-1.07) for the dietary intake of beta-carotene. Notably, no 
significant dose-response relationship was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: A high dietary intake of vitamin C (≥ 75 mg/d) was found to have a 
statistically significant impact on reducing the risk of AD. However, no 
significant association was observed between dietary intake of vitamin E or 
beta-carotene, or the use of vitamin E or vitamin C supplement use, and the risk 
of AD.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal dysfunction induced by soluble amyloid-β oligomers (oAβ) 
is an early neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). oAβ shifts 
hippocampal synaptic-plasticity induction threshold facilitating long-term 
depression (LTD) instead of long-term potentiation (LTP, the functional basis of 
memory), thereby leading to memory deficits in early AD-like amyloidosis mouse 
models. In this regard, the spatial distribution of the underlying 
synaptic-plasticity/memory proteome changes in the hippocampus, and potential 
sex differences, remain unknown. Here we postulated that some protein changes 
related to synaptic-plasticity and memory may be unique to sex and/or specific 
to the dorsal or ventral hippocampus -as both regions have distinct 
functionality and connectivity-, potentially providing sex- and spatial-specific 
proteomic phenotypes for early AD-amyloidosis interventions.
METHODS: An innovative spatial-resolution proteomics study was performed to map 
whole hippocampal proteome distribution using matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry. For this purpose, 
sixteen adult male and female mouse brains intracerebroventricularly injected 
with oAβ1-42/vehicle were analyzed. MALDI-imaging RapifleXTM-MALDI-TissuetyperTM 
TOF/TOF mass spectrometer was used, followed by traditional tandem mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS) for precise protein identification on tissue.
RESULTS: 34 proteins showed significant differences in expression levels due to 
treatment, sex, or hippocampal location among 234 peptides initially detected; 
and displayed significant protein-protein interaction (PPI), indicating main 
functional relationship to LTP/LTD pathways and memory. Thus, 14 proteins 
related to synaptic-plasticity and/or AD were further studied, showing that most 
modulated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a protein widely involved in 
synaptic-plasticity induction threshold regulation towards LTD. Accordingly, 
hippocampal GSK-3β was found to be overactivated in AD-like amyloidosis mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first-time specific sex-dependent 
synaptic-plasticity proteome changes in dorsal/ventral hippocampi that modulate 
GSK-3β activity. These findings provide new insight into the early amyloidosis 
pathogenesis in AD and offer valuable, unique proteomic phenotypes as potential 
biomarkers and targets for early diagnosis and therapy in both sexes.

Plain Language Summary: Previous proteomic studies have shown hippocampal 
synaptic-plasticity proteins alterations in Alzheimer’s disease. However, the 
spatial distribution and sex-dependence of these proteomic changes remain 
unknown. We used MALDI imaging to map the spatial proteomic signatures of the 
dorsal and ventral hippocampi induced by early amyloidosis in male and female 
mice. Spatial- and sex- dependent proteome alterations were found functionally 
related to long-term synaptic plasticity and memory and were associated with 
GSK-3β overactivation, thus providing unique potential biomarkers and targets 
for early diagnosis and treatment.

Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), affects millions worldwide, 
leading to cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral disturbances. 
Agitation, a common symptom, poses significant challenges for patients and 
caregivers. This systematic review evaluates pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological interventions for managing agitation in dementia. Nine 
clinical studies were analyzed, encompassing medications like brexpiprazole and 
non-pharmacological approaches such as music therapy and digital care programs. 
Pharmacological treatments showed mixed efficacy and safety profiles, with 
brexpiprazole demonstrating dose-dependent benefits and mirtazapine associating 
with higher mortality rates. Non-pharmacological interventions exhibited 
promising results in reducing agitation without adverse effects. The review 
underscores the importance of personalized care strategies tailored to 
individual patient needs and preferences to enhance treatment efficacy and 
quality of life, highlighting the shift toward holistic, individualized care.

AIMS: Isoliquiritigenin is a natural flavonoid extracted from the root of the 
medicinal herb liquorice. Isoliquiritigenin has various biological effects, 
including antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic 
activities, and improved mitochondrial function in earlier studies. Tau 
hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play 
important roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we assessed the 
neuroprotective effects of isoliquiritigenin on a streptozotocin-injected mouse 
model.
MATERIALS: Molecular docking analysis of isoliquiritigenin with mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) and ERK2. The mice (n = 27, male) were 
intracerebroventricularly injected with streptozotocin, treated with 
isoliquiritigenin (intraperitoneal, 2 days) and assessed using the Morris water 
maze. Oxidative stress, tau phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and 
synaptic impairment were evaluated in the cortex and hippocampal tissues of the 
mice by using biochemical assays and immunostaining.
RESULTS: Isoliquiritigenin treatment mitigated the spatial memory capacity of 
streptozotocin-injected mice and alleviated tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and 
Thr231, the production of reactive oxygen species, the intracellular ATP level, 
the mitochondrial proteins p-DRP1 (S616), Mfn1 and Mfn2, neuronal loss, and 
synaptic impairment (PSD95, SNAP25). Isoliquiritigenin treatment reduced the 
levels of mTOR Ser2448 and ERK2 Thr202/Tyr204 and upregulated the level of 
GSK-3β Ser9 in the cortex and hippocampus of streptozotocin-injected mice.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our findings suggest that isoliquiritigenin 
ameliorates streptozotocin-induced cognitive impairment, hyperphosphorylated 
tau, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic impairment by 
decreasing mTOR and ERK activity and increasing GSK-3β activity.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an effective pleiotropic drug with a strong safety 
profile. It is predominantly used as a mucolytic agent and in the treatment of 
paracetamol overdose. However, extensive research in the last decade has shown 
the prominent efficacy of NAC in many neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative 
disorders. NAC acts through multiple mechanisms; primarily, it releases cysteine 
and modulates glutamatergic and monoaminergic transmission. Further, it restores 
glutathione levels, promotes oxidative balance, reverses decreased synaptic 
plasticity, reduces neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
provides neurotrophic support. Additionally, it regulates one-carbon metabolism 
pathways, leading to the production of key metabolites. In this review, we will 
be discussing in-depth mechanisms of action of NAC and its promising ability to 
reverse neuropathological changes, cognitive deficits and associated plasticity 
changes in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including 
depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's 
disease, traumatic brain injury, aging. Overall, several preclinical studies and 
clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of NAC in reversing regressive 
plasticity, cognitive deficits, and associated changes in the brain. NAC remains 
among the strongest candidates with a high safety profile for managing several 
types of neurological disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia in older individuals, 
exhibiting an increasing incidence worldwide. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality 
control has been receiving attention in the pathology of AD. The accumulation of 
misfolded proteins in the ER will activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), 
leading to cellular apoptosis. Using a mouse model of 5xFAD, we found that 
physical exercise (PE) promoted the clearance of ER fragments and inhibited the 
ER stress via ER autophagy (ER - Phagy). As a result, physical exercise reduced 
Aβ deposition, inhibited the neuronal apoptosis, ameliorated the emotional and 
cognitive impairments. Mechanistically, these PE related effects may be linked 
to the increased FAM134B, an ER-Phagy receptor, by up-regulating neuronal 
progranulin (Pgrn). Recombinant Pgrn injection could mimic the protective 
effects of PE, whereas down-regulation of Pgrn could abolish the PE-associated 
protection. Our findings indicate that physical exercise, as a readily 
accessible lifestyle intervention, holds significant potential for preventing 
diseases related to the global aging population.

BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) change during 
preclinical stages, indicating potential for detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology 
in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. Given the need for accurate, 
scalable biomarkers, we evaluated a fully automated plasma panel to detect and 
monitor longitudinal Aβ accumulation in CU individuals.
METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we examined a plasma panel (Aβ42/40, 
p-tau181, GFAP, NfL, p-tau217 and ApoE4) in CU participants at risk for AD. We 
assessed the biomarkers' performance to detect Aβ pathology and the 
cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between the biomarkers and Aβ 
accumulation, neurodegeneration and cognition.
FINDINGS: We included 400 middle-aged CU participants, of whom 135 (33.8%) were 
CSF Aβ-positive. All plasma biomarkers differed between Aβ-positive and 
-negative individuals, with plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau217, p-tau181/Aβ42, and 
p-tau217/Aβ42 showing the best performance in detecting A+ CU individuals. 
However, plasma Aβ42/40 was sensitive to random variability. Plasma 
p-tau217/Aβ42 had the highest performance in detecting PET A+ individuals (AUC = 
0.94). All baseline plasma biomarkers were associated with longitudinal 
increases in Aβ deposition (mean follow-up [SD]: 3.27 ± 0.5). Longitudinal 
changes in plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ42 were associated with concurrent 
changes in Aβ (both CSF and PET) and soluble tau pathology.
INTERPRETATION: In CU individuals, several plasma biomarkers at baseline detect 
Aβ accumulation and are associated with its short-term change. Plasma p-tau217, 
and p-tau217/Aβ42 longitudinal changes reflect concurrent Aβ accumulation during 
this period. These findings help enrich studies in CU individuals at risk of 
progressing to AD.
