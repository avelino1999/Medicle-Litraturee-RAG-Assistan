Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a major worldwide health challenge because of its 
profound impact on cognitive abilities and overall well-being. Despite extensive 
research and numerous clinical trials, therapeutic options remain limited. Our 
study aimed to investigate the potential of Kelulut honey (KH) as a novel 
therapeutic agent for addressing the multifactorial pathology of AD. We tried to 
evaluate the disease-attenuating and neuroprotective potential of KH in the 
intrahippocampally induced AD rat model by utilizing histochemistry and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies. A total of 26 male Sprague 
Dawley rats weighing ~280-380 g were randomly divided into three groups: 
Control, AD-induced (Aβ), and AD-induced and treated with KH (Aβ+KH). The latter 
two groups underwent stereotaxic surgery, where 6.25 µg of amyloid β1-42 
peptides were injected intrahippocampally. One-week post-surgery, KH was 
administered to the treatment group at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight for a period 
of four weeks, after which the rats went through behavior tests. After 
completion of behavior analysis, the rats were sacrificed, and the brains were 
processed for histochemistry and ELISA studies. The open field test analysis 
demonstrated that KH improved the locomotion of Aβ+KH compared to Aβ (p = 
0.0013). In comparison, the Morris water maze did not show any nootropic effects 
on cognition with a paradoxical increase in time spent in the target quadrant by 
the Aβ group (p = 0.029). Histochemical staining showed markedly increased 
Congo-red-stained amyloid plaques, which were significantly reduced in dentate 
gyrus of Aβ+KH compared to Aβ (p < 0.05). Moreover, significantly higher 
apoptosis was seen in the Aβ group compared to Aβ+KH (p < 0.01) and control 
groups (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the ELISA studies deduced more phosphorylated 
tau in the diseased group compared to Aβ+KH (p = 0.038) and controls (p = 
0.016). These findings suggest that KH consumption for twenty-eight days has the 
potential to attenuate the pathological burden of disease while exerting 
neuroprotective effects in rodent models of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently been associated with diverse cell 
states1-11, yet when and how these states affect the onset of AD remains 
unclear. Here we used a data-driven approach to reconstruct the dynamics of the 
brain's cellular environment and identified a trajectory leading to AD that is 
distinct from other ageing-related effects. First, we built a comprehensive cell 
atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex from 1.65 million single-nucleus 
RNA-sequencing profiles sampled from 437 older individuals, and identified 
specific glial and neuronal subpopulations associated with AD-related traits. 
Causal modelling then prioritized two distinct lipid-associated microglial 
subpopulations-one drives amyloid-β proteinopathy while the other mediates the 
effect of amyloid-β on tau proteinopathy-as well as an astrocyte subpopulation 
that mediates the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the dynamics of 
cellular environments, we devised the BEYOND methodology, which identified two 
distinct trajectories of brain ageing, each defined by coordinated progressive 
changes in certain cellular communities that lead to (1) AD dementia or (2) 
alternative brain ageing. Thus, we provide a cellular foundation for a new 
perspective on AD pathophysiology that informs personalized therapeutic 
development, targeting different cellular communities for individuals on the 
path to AD or to alternative brain ageing.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains the foremost cause of dementia and represents a 
significant unmet healthcare need globally. The complex pathogenesis of AD, 
characterized by various pathological and physiological events, has historically 
challenged the development of anti-AD drugs. However, recent breakthroughs in AD 
drug development, including the approvals of aducanumab, lecanemab, and sodium 
oligomannate (GV-971), have ended a nearly two-decade hiatus in the introduction 
of new AD drugs. These developments have addressed long-standing challenges in 
AD drug development, marking a substantial shift in the therapeutic landscape of 
AD. Moreover, natural products (NPs) have shown promise in AD drug research, 
with several currently under clinical investigation. Their distinct properties 
and mechanisms of action offer new avenues to complement and enhance existing AD 
treatment approaches. This review article aims to provide an overview of the 
recent advancements and prospects in AD therapeutics, focusing on both NPs and 
approved drugs.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of dementia associated with sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) 
inhibitors in adults aged 40-69 years with type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN: Population based cohort study.
SETTING: Korean National Health Insurance Service data, 2013-21.
PARTICIPANTS: 110 885 propensity score matched pairs of adults with type 2 
diabetes aged 40-69 years who were initiators of either an SGLT-2 inhibitor or a 
DPP-4 inhibitor.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was new onset dementia. Secondary 
outcomes were dementia requiring drug treatment and individual types of 
dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Control outcomes 
were genital infections (positive), and osteoarthritis related clinical 
encounters and cataract surgery (negative). Hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox models. Follow-up time stratified 
analyses (>2 years and ≤2 years) and subgroup analyses by age, sex, concomitant 
use of metformin, and baseline cardiovascular risk were performed.
RESULTS: 110 885 propensity score matched pairs of initiators of an SGLT-2 
inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor were followed-up for a mean 670 (standard 
deviation 650) days, generating 1172 people with newly diagnosed dementia: 
incidence rate 0.22 per 100 person years in initiators of SGLT-2 inhibitors and 
0.35 per 100 person years in initiators of DPP-4 inhibitors, with hazard ratios 
of 0.65 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.73) for dementia, 0.54 (0.46 to 0.63) for dementia 
requiring drugs, 0.61 (0.53 to 0.69) for Alzheimer's disease, and 0.48 (0.33 to 
0.70) for vascular dementia. The hazard ratios for the control outcomes were 
2.67 (2.57 to 2.77) for genital infections, 0.97 (0.95 to 0.98) for 
osteoarthritis related encounters, and 0.92 (0.89 to 0.96) for cataract surgery. 
When calibrated for residual confounding measured by cataract surgery, the 
hazard ratio for dementia was 0.70 (0.62 to 0.80). The association was greater 
for more than two years of treatment (hazard ratio of dementia 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 
to 0.70) than for two years or less (0.52, 0.41 to 0.66) and persisted across 
subgroups.
CONCLUSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors might prevent dementia, providing greater benefits 
with longer treatment. As this study was observational and therefore prone to 
residual confounding and informative censoring, the effect size could have been 
overestimated. Randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these 
findings.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegeneration which 
currently has no effective treatment. Ferroptosis is a new style of programmed 
cell death and is widely implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. 
Decursin has been shown widely neuroprotective effects but poorly understood 
about the underlying mechanisms between decursin and ferroptosis in AD. Here, 
the protective effect of decursin and the underlying mechanism under glutamate 
treatment in SH-SY5Y cells was investigated. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured with 
glutamate in the presence or absence of decursin. The safe concentrations of 
decursin on SH-SY5Y cells were measured via CCK-8. Furthermore, LDH content, 
antioxidant enzyme activities including GPx, CAT and SOD, MDA contents, GSH 
levels, ROS formation, MMP, mitochondria ultrastructure morphology change, and 
intracellular Fe2+ levels were measured to investigate the influence of decursin 
and Fer-1 on ferroptosis in glutamate-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the 
expressions of ferroptosis-related proteins were determined by Western blot. As 
a result, glutamate-induced cell survival was markedly elevated and 
morphological change was improved by decursin administrated in SH-SY5Y cells. 
Furthermore, decursin could reversed the decreased antioxidant enzyme 
activities, GSH levels, GPX4n and FTH1 expression, as well as the increased iron 
levels, LDH, MDA, ROS formation, and MMP, which showed similar effects to Fer-1, 
the specific ferroptosis inhibitor. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of decursin 
on ferroptosis probably was partially governed by FTH1 expression to regulate 
the cellular iron homeostasis. Additionally, decursin facilitated the 
translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Taken together, our 
data for the first time suggest that decursin could ameliorate neurotoxicity 
induced by glutamate by attenuating ferroptosis via alleviating cellular iron 
levels by up-regulating FTH1 expression which is attributing to its promotion of 
Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Hence, 
decursin might be a novel and promising therapeutic option for AD. In addition, 
our study also provided some new clues to potential target for the intervention 
and therapy of AD.

An increased understanding of the predisposing genetics and complex pathogenic 
mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease have facilitated delineation of the long 
preclinical course and re-invigorated the search for disease-modifying 
treatments. Establishment of accurate blood-based biomarkers has enabled 
preclinical identification of early disease and permits trials of preventative 
treatment and quantitative monitoring of therapeutic effects. The broad range of 
therapeutic possibilities encompasses gene editing, enzyme activators and 
inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides, and antagonists of receptors for 
inflammatory mediators.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia. The aging 
brain is particularly vulnerable to various stressors, including increased 
levels of ceramide. However, the role of ceramide in neuronal cell senescence 
and AD progression and whether icariin, a natural flavonoid glucoside, could 
reverse neuronal senescence remain inadequately understood.
AIM: In this study, we explore the role of ceramide in neuronal senescence and 
AD, and whether icariin can counteract these effects.
METHODS: We pretreated HT-22 cells with icariin and then induced senescence with 
ceramide. Various assays were employed to assess cell senescence, such as 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell cycle progression, 
β-galactosidase staining, and expression of senescence-associated proteins. In 
vivo studies utilized APP/PS1 mice and C57BL/6J mice injected with ceramide to 
evaluate behavioral changes, histopathological alterations, and 
senescence-associated protein expression. Transcriptomics, molecular docking, 
molecular dynamics simulations, and cellular thermal shift assays were employed 
to verify the interaction between icariin and P53. The specificity of icariin 
targeting of P53 was further confirmed through rescue experiments utilizing the 
P53 activator Navtemadlin.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that ceramide could induce neuronal senescence 
and AD-related pathologies, which were reversed by icariin. Moreover, molecular 
studies revealed that icariin directly targeted P53, and its neuroprotective 
effects were attenuated by P53 activation, providing evidence for the role of 
P53 in icariin-mediated neuroprotection.
CONCLUSION: Icariin demonstrates a protective effect against ceramide-induced 
neuronal senescence by inhibiting the P53 pathway. This identifies a novel 
mechanism of action for icariin, offering a novel therapeutic approach for AD 
and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis has been associated with the gut 
microbiome and its metabolites, though the specific mechanisms have remained 
unclear. In our study, we used a multi-omics approach to identify specific 
microbial strains and metabolites that could potentially mitigate amyloidopathy 
in 5xFAD mice, a widely used model for AD research. Among the microbial strains 
tested, three showed promising results in reducing soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
levels. Plasma metabolomics analysis revealed an enrichment of tryptophan (Trp) 
and indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) in mice with reduced soluble Aβ levels, 
suggesting a potential preventative role. The administration of a combined 
treatment of Trp and ILA prevented both Aβ accumulation and cognitive impairment 
in the 5xFAD mice. Our investigation into the mechanism revealed that ILA's 
effect on reducing Aβ levels was mediated through the activation of microglia 
and astrocytes, facilitated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling 
pathway. These mechanisms were verified through experiments in 5xFAD mice that 
included an additional group with the administration of ILA alone, as well as in 
vitro experiments using an AhR inhibitor. Clinical data analysis revealed a 
greater abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri in the gut of healthy individuals 
compared to those at early stages of Aβ accumulation or with mild cognitive 
impairment. Additionally, human post-mortem brain analyses showed an increased 
expression of genes associated with the AhR signaling pathway in individuals 
without AD, suggesting a protective effect against AD progression. Our results 
indicate that ILA from gut microbes could inhibit the progression of 
amyloidopathy in 5xFAD mice through activation of AhR signaling in the brain.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is caused by various diseases, including Alzheimer's 
disease dementia (ADD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We often encounter 
patients with dementia who have limited shoulder joint range of motion (ROM), 
especially those with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). 
But the relationship between the diseases of dementia and restricted shoulder 
joint ROM is currently unclear.
METHODS: We examined cognitive function and shoulder joint ROM in 234 new 
outpatients at 7 memory clinics in Japan. We assessed cognitive function using 
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale 
(HDS-R) and BPSD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). 
Patients were categorized by dementia diagnosis (ADD, DLB, other dementia, and 
control). Right, left, and total shoulder joint ROM was assessed using validated 
the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score.
RESULTS: We found significant associations of lower right, left, and total 
shoulder joint ROM scores with male sex, advanced age, higher NPI-Q score, lower 
HDS-R, and MMSE scores. Little difference was found between right and left 
shoulder joint ROM scores. Restricted shoulder joint ROM was related to serial 
7, verbal frequency domain scores on the HDS-R and repeat score on the MMSE. It 
was also related to the hallucinations, irritability/lability and nighttime 
disturbances scores on the NPI-Q. Furthermore, the dementia groups, especially 
the DLB group, showed worse shoulder joint ROM than the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Dementia was significantly related to restricted shoulder joint 
ROM. Maintaining communication and social interaction may help maintain shoulder 
joint ROM.

AIMS: 5 mC methylation and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) are associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, previous studies were limited by the absence 
of a 5hmC calculation. This study aims to find AD associated predictors and 
potential therapeutic chemicals using bioinformatics approach integrating 5 mC, 
5hmC, and expression changes, and an AD mouse model.
METHODS: Gene expression microarray and 5 mC and 5hmC sequencing datasets were 
downloaded from GEO repository. 142 AD and 52 normal entorhinal cortex specimens 
were enrolled. Data from oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS)-treated samples, 
which represent only 5 mC, were used to calculate 5hmC level. Functional 
analyses, random forest supervised classification and methylation validation 
were applied. Potential chemicals were predicted by CMap. Morris water maze, Y 
maze and novel object recognition behavior tests were performed using FAD4T AD 
mice model. Cortex and hippocampus tissues were isolated for immunohistochemical 
staining.
RESULTS: C1QTNF5, UBD, ZFP106, NEDD1, AKT3, and MBP genes involving 13 promoter 
CpG sites with 5mc, 5hmC methylation and expression difference were identified. 
AKT3 and MBP were down-regulated in both patients and mouse model. Three CpG 
sites in AKT3 and MBP showed significant methylation difference on validation. 
FAD4T AD mice showed recession in brain functions and lower AKT3 expression in 
both cortex and hippocampus. Ten chemicals were predicted as potential 
treatments for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: AKT3 and MBP may be associated with AD pathology and could serve as 
biomarkers. The ten predicted chemicals might offer new therapeutic approaches. 
Our findings could contribute to identifying novel markers and advancing the 
understanding of AD mechanisms.

Polygala tenuifolia is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine. Polygala 
tenuifolia polysaccharide (PTP), as one of its main active ingredients, has 
excellent neuroprotective activity. PTP improved the disruption of the 
endogenous metabolites and gut microbiota caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Specifically, untargeted metabolomics results showed that 19 metabolites such as 
leukotriene B4, vanylglycol, and cer(d18:1/18:0) are significantly reduced, and 
2 metabolites are elevated. It was significantly enriched in Sphingolipid 
metabolism, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, Tyrosine metabolism, and Arachidonic 
acid metabolism. Meanwhile, 16S rDNA analysis showed that PTP treatment 
significantly increased the relative abundance of bacteria such as Alistipes, 
Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006. In addition, 
Spearman analysis showed that significant changes in gut microbiota were closely 
related to differential endogenous metabolites.

Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) is a rich source of dietary bioactive 
compounds such as rosmarinic acid and carnosol with a large repertoire of 
pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective 
activities. In the present study, we investigated rosemary as a potential new 
therapeutic agent for cognitive function and other symptoms of aging. In this 
present study, we have aimed to investigate the effects of oral administration 
of rosemary extract (RME) on learning and memory in the context of other 
biomarkers-related cognitive function and neurotransmitter levels in senescent 
accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse, a model of accelerating aging and Alzheimer's 
disease. The Morris water maze (MWM) test showed improved spatial learning and 
memory behavior in RME treated SAMP8 mouse. Moreover, RME decreased Aβ42 and 
inflammatory cytokine levels and increased BDNF, Sirt1, and neurotransmitter 
levels in SAMP8 mouse. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed that RME 
significantly increased gene expression related to oligodendrocyte 
differentiation, myelination, and ATP production in the hippocampus and 
decreased gene expression related to stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. 
Also, in the SAMP8 hippocampus, RME significantly increased Olig1 and Olig2 
expression. Altogether, our study is the first to report improvement of spatial 
learning and memory of RME, modulation of genes important for 
oligodendrogenesis, and Anti-neuroinflammatory effect by suppressing Aβ42 levels 
in mouse brain and thus highlights the prospects of RME in the treatment of 
cognitive dysfunction and aging.

Effects of Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. and Levodopa in Improving Parkinson's 
Disease in Rotenone Intoxicated Mice.

Republic of Korea.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative disease after 
Alzheimer's disease. Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. (MP) is a plant that contains 
Levodopa (L-DOPA) and has been known to improve the symptoms of PD. In this 
preliminary study, we investigated the anti-parkinsonian potential of MP to 
compare the effects of L-DOPA. We first developed an in vivo model of the PD in 
C57BL/6 male mice using rotenone. A total of twelve mice were used for this 
experiment. Nine mice were injected with rotenone (28 mg/kg) daily for 28 days. 
The mice experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of MP to treat 
PD. Synthetic L-DOPA in a ratio of 1:20 with MP was used as MP contains 5% 
L-DOPA by weight in it. MP and L-DOPA were injected for 19 days on a daily 
basis. Cognitive function was evaluated using beam balance and olfactory tests. 
Serum analysis was performed using serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) analysis test. IL-12, IL-6, and TGF-β 1 were evaluated to validate the 
PD inducement and treatment. The levels of IL-12, IL-6, and TGF-β1 (p < 0.0001) 
in the PD mice group were significantly higher than those in the control group. 
The PD mice also showed higher latencies in beam balance and olfactory tests (p 
< 0.0001) compared to the control group. Both MP and L-DOPA-treated groups 
showed alleviation in latencies in beam balance and olfactory tests and 
decreased neuroinflammation in ELISA analysis (p < 0.001). The results treated 
by MP and L-DOPA showed insignificant differences in their values (p > 0.05). 
This proved that the MP and L-DOPA had similar effects in improving the symptoms 
of PD when used in the ratio of 1:20. Furthermore, both MP and L-DOPA reduced 
the level of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in this study. It may be inferred that a reduction 
in the level of IL-6 and TGF-β1 eventually leads to a reduction in the Th17 
cells. The pathogenic Th17 is thought to be present in virtually all chronic 
inflammatory disorders. This can be an interesting area of research in further 
understanding the immunological effect of MP in ameliorating PD symptoms.

Estrogen is a significant hormone that is involved in a multitude of 
physiological and pathological processes. In addition to its pivotal role in the 
reproductive system, estrogen is also implicated in the pathogenesis of a 
multitude of diseases. Nevertheless, previous research on the role of estrogen 
in a multitude of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, depression, 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal diseases, and 
estrogen-dependent cancers, has concentrated on a single disease area, resulting 
in a lack of comprehensive understanding of cross-disease mechanisms. This has 
brought some challenges to the current treatment methods for these diseases, 
because estrogen as a potential therapeutic tool has not yet fully developed its 
potential. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively explore the mechanism 
of estrogen in these seven types of diseases. The objective of this study is to 
describe the relationship between each disease and estrogen, including the ways 
in which estrogen participates in regulating disease mechanisms, and to outline 
the efficacy of estrogen in treating these diseases in clinical practice. By 
studying the role of estrogen in a variety of disease mechanisms, it is hoped 
that a more accurate theoretical basis and clinical guidance for future 
treatment strategies will be provided, thus promoting the effective management 
and treatment of these diseases.

Assessing Delirium Severity in Dementia: Item Development and Psychometric 
Validation for a Delirium Severity Instrument.

Hshieh T, Schulman-Green D, Fong TG, Metzger E, Arias F, Helfand B, Marcantonio 
E, Schmitt E, Tabloski P, Jones RN, Inouye SK.

PURPOSE: Despite the importance of measuring delirium severity in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), no validated instrument 
currently exists. Our goal was to generate items for use in such an instrument.
METHOD: An interdisciplinary expert panel developed items to assess seven 
domains and 21 subdomains of delirium severity. Nursing experts provided input 
on items.
RESULTS: Experts achieved consensus on 21 items, including best respondents for 
each item, and appropriate look-back periods. Nursing experts emphasized the 
need for educating nursing staff and obtaining information from caregivers.
CONCLUSION: Careful, nuanced identification of distinguishing features is key 
for generating items for measuring delirium severity in persons with ADRD. Once 
developed, engaging nurses will be essential to facilitate adoption and 
relevance of the tool. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 50(9), 24-30.].

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and osteoporosis 
(OP) are 2 prevalent diseases of aging with demonstrated epidemiological 
association, but the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to this 
association are unknown.
METHODS: We used network analysis of bone and brain transcriptomes to discover 
common molecular mechanisms underlying these 2 diseases. Our study included 
RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue of autopsied 
brains in 629 participants from ROSMAP (Religious Orders Study and the Rush 
Memory and Aging Project), with a subgroup of 298 meeting criteria for inclusion 
in 5 ADRD categories, and RNA array data from transiliac bone biopsies in 84 
participants from the Oslo study of postmenopausal women. After developing each 
network within each tissue, we analyzed associations between modules (groups of 
coexpressed genes) with multiple bone and neurological traits, examined overlap 
in modules between networks, and performed pathway enrichment analysis to 
discover conserved mechanisms.
RESULTS: We discovered 3 modules in ROSMAP that showed significant associations 
with ADRD and bone-related traits and 4 modules in Oslo that showed significant 
associations with multiple bone outcomes. We found significant module overlap 
between the 2 networks in modules linked to signaling, tissue homeostasis, and 
development, and Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling was found to 
be highly enriched in OP and ADRD modules of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide translational opportunities in the 
development of treatments and biomarkers for ADRD and OP.

Neuroprotective Effect of Famotidine in Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease.

Sadiq MH, Al-Zubaidy AA.

BACKGROUND: Famotidine is a competitive histamine H-receptor antagonist that 
reduces the formation of stomach acid and is used to treat gastrointestinal 
disorders associated with acid reflux, gastroesophageal reflux disease, duodenal 
ulcer, gastric ulcer, and pathological hypersecretory disorders. This study is 
designed to investigate the possible neuroprotective effects of the ranolazine 
scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease-like feature in a mouse model.
METHODS: Mice were divided equally into five groups (ten mice per group), 
including control group and induction group. The mice in the induction group 
were administered scopolamine 1 mg/kg i.p., once daily for 7 days, to induce 
features similar to Alzheimer's disease. The mice in the remaining three 
treatment groups were given tested medications prophylactically for 14 days. 
After that the induction was carried out with scopolamine 1 mg/kg i.p., once 
daily, while the tested medication dosages were continued for an additional 7 
days. These treatment groups included: the donepezil group (5 mg/kg/day), the 
famotidine group (40 mg/kg/day) and the combined group with donepezil (5 
mg/kg/day) and famotidine (40 mg/kg/day); all were administrated i.p., once 
daily. Behavioral parameters were assessed, among others with the Y-maze test 
and novel object recognition test, and the inflammatory cytokines and oxidative 
stress parameters were assessed as well.
RESULTS: Famotidine exhibits significant improvements in behavior and memory, 
level of oxidative stress parame-ter, and inflammatory cytokines.
CONCLUSIONS: Famotidine and its combination at prescribed doses in the current 
study improved learning and memory impairments in mice model of Alzheimer's 
disease probably via their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties 
confirmed by a significant increase in antioxidant mediator and a significant 
decrease in oxidative stress marker and inflammatory cytokines.

INTRODUCTION: The established link between DNA methylation and pathophysiology 
of dementia, along with its potential role as a molecular mediator of lifestyle 
and environmental influences, positions blood-derived DNA methylation as a 
promising tool for early dementia risk detection.
METHODS: In conjunction with an extensive array of machine learning techniques, 
we employed whole blood genome-wide DNA methylation data as a surrogate for 14 
modifiable and non-modifiable factors in the assessment of dementia risk in 
independent dementia cohorts.
RESULTS: We established a multivariate methylation risk score (MMRS) for 
identifying mild cognitive impairment cross-sectionally, independent of age and 
sex (P = 2.0 × 10-3). This score significantly predicted the prospective 
development of cognitive impairments in independent studies of Alzheimer's 
disease (hazard ratio for Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT)-Learning = 2.47) and Parkinson's disease (hazard ratio for 
MCI/dementia = 2.59).
DISCUSSION: Our work shows the potential of employing blood-derived DNA 
methylation data in the assessment of dementia risk.
HIGHLIGHTS: We used whole blood DNA methylation as a surrogate for 14 dementia 
risk factors. Created a multivariate methylation risk score for predicting 
cognitive impairment. Emphasized the role of machine learning and omics data in 
predicting dementia. The score predicts cognitive impairment development at the 
population level.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated blood DNA methylation patterns associated with 15 
well-established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathophysiology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: We assessed DNA methylation in 885 blood samples from the European 
Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD) study using the 
EPIC array.
RESULTS: We identified Bonferroni-significant differential methylation 
associated with CSF YKL-40 (five loci) and neurofilament light chain (NfL; seven 
loci) levels, with two of the loci associated with CSF YKL-40 levels correlating 
with plasma YKL-40 levels. A co-localization analysis showed shared genetic 
variants underlying YKL-40 DNA methylation and CSF protein levels, with evidence 
that DNA methylation mediates the association between genotype and protein 
levels. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified two modules of 
co-methylated loci correlated with several amyloid measures and enriched in 
pathways associated with lipoproteins and development.
DISCUSSION: We conducted the most comprehensive epigenome-wide association study 
(EWAS) of AD-relevant CSF biomarkers to date. Future work should explore the 
relationship between YKL-40 genotype, DNA methylation, and protein levels in the 
brain.
HIGHLIGHTS: Blood DNA methylation was assessed in the EMIF-AD MBD study. 
Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) were performed for 15 Alzheimer's 
disease (AD)-relevant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker measures. Five 
Bonferroni-significant loci were associated with YKL-40 levels and seven with 
neurofilament light chain (NfL). DNA methylation in YKL-40 co-localized with 
previously reported genetic variation. DNA methylation potentially mediates the 
effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in YKL-40 on CSF protein 
levels.

BACKGROUND: Associations between magnetic resonance imaging markers of cerebral 
small vessel disease (CSVD) and dementia risk in older adults have been 
established, but it remains unclear how lifestyle factors, including 
psychosocial health, may modify this association.
METHODS: Social support and social isolation were assessed among participants of 
the community-based ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Study, via 
self-reported questionnaires (1990-1992). Following categorization of both 
factors, participants were classified as having strong or poor mid-life social 
relationships. At visit 5 (2011-2013), participants underwent 3T brain magnetic 
resonance imaging quantifying CSVD measures: white matter hyperintensity volume, 
microbleeds (subcortical), infarcts (lacunar), and white matter integrity 
(diffusion tensor imaging). Incident dementia cases were identified from the 
time of imaging through December 31, 2020 with ongoing surveillance. 
Associations between CSVD magnetic resonance imaging markers and incident 
dementia were evaluated using Cox proportional-hazard regressions adjusted for 
demographic and additional risk factors (from visit 2). Effect modification by 
mid-life social relationships was evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 1977 participants with magnetic resonance imaging, 1617 
participants (60.7% women; 26.5% Black participants; mean age at visit 2, 55.4 
years) were examined. In this sample, mid-life social relationships 
significantly modified the association between white matter hyperintensity 
volume and dementia risk (P interaction=0.001). Greater white matter 
hyperintensity volume was significantly associated with risk of dementia in all 
participants, yet, more substantially in those with poor (hazard ratio, 1.84 
[95% CI, 1.49-2.27]) versus strong (hazard ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.08-1.47]) 
mid-life social relationships. Although not statistically significant, 
subcortical microbleeds in participants with poor mid-life social relationships 
were associated with a greater risk of dementia, relative to those with strong 
social relationships, in whom subcortical microbleeds were no longer associated 
with elevated dementia risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The elevated risk of dementia associated with CSVD may be reduced 
in participants with strong mid-life social relationships. Future studies 
evaluating psychosocial health through the life course and the mechanisms by 
which they modify the relationship between CSVD and dementia are needed.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly heterogeneous, with substantial 
individual variabilities in clinical progression and neurobiology. Amyloid 
deposition has been thought to drive cognitive decline and thus a major 
contributor to the variations in cognitive deterioration in AD. However, the 
clinical heterogeneity of patients with early symptomatic AD (mild cognitive 
impairment or mild dementia due to AD) already with evidence of amyloid 
abnormality in the brain is still unknown.
METHODS: Participants with a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or 
mild dementia, a positive amyloid-PET scan, and more than one follow-up 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale-13 (ADAS-Cog-13) 
administration within a period of 5-year follow-up were selected from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (n = 421; age = 73±7; years 
of education = 16 ± 3; percentage of female gender = 43%; distribution of APOE4 
carriers = 68%). A non-parametric k-means longitudinal clustering analysis in 
the context of the ADAS-Cog-13 data was performed to identify cognitive 
subtypes.
RESULTS: We found a highly variable profile of cognitive decline among patients 
with early AD and identified 4 clusters characterized by distinct rates of 
cognitive progression. Among the groups there were significant differences in 
the magnitude of rates of changes in other cognitive and functional outcomes, 
clinical progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, and changes in 
markers presumed to reflect neurodegeneration and neuronal injury. A nomogram 
based on a simplified logistic regression model predicted steep cognitive 
trajectory with an AUC of 0.912 (95% CI: 0.88 - 0.94). Simulation of clinical 
trials suggested that the incorporation of the nomogram into enrichment 
strategies would reduce the required sample sizes from 926.8 (95% CI: 822.6 - 
1057.5) to 400.9 (95% CI: 306.9 - 516.8).
DISCUSSION: Our findings show usefulness in the stratification of patients in 
early AD and may thus increase the chances of finding a treatment for future AD 
clinical trials.

Background: The development of effective inhibitors that can inhibit amyloid β 
(Aβ) peptides aggregation and promote neurite outgrowth is crucial for the 
possible treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lobaria (Schreb.) Hoffm., a 
traditional Chinese medicine used in Himalaya region for inflammatory diseases, 
contains depsides/depsidones (DEPs) such as gyrophoric acid, norstictic acid, 
and stictic acid known for their anti-cancer and anti-inflammation properties. 
Methods: Lobaria extracts were analyzed using HPLC to identify DEPs and 
establish standards. The inhibitory effects of Lobaria on Aβ42 fibrillization 
and depolymerization were assessed using various approaches with biophysical and 
cellular methods. The neuroprotective activity of Lobaria extracts and its DEPs 
aganist Aβ-mediated cytotoxicity was also evaluated. Results: Norstictic and 
stictic acid were found in the water extract, while norstictic, stictic, and 
gyrophoric acid were detected in the ethanol extract of Lobaria. Both extracts, 
and their DEPs effectively inhibited Aβ42 fibrillation and disaggregate mature 
Aβ42 fibrils. Notably, the ethanol extract showed superior inhibitory effect 
compared to the water extract, with gyrophoric acid being the most effective 
DEPs. Additionally, herbal extract-treated Aβ42 aggregation species 
significantly protected neuronal cells from Aβ42-induced cell damage and 
promoted neurite outgrowth. Conclusion: This study is the first to investigate 
the effect of Lobaria on Aβ42 and neuronal cell in AD. Given that Lobaria is 
commonly used in ethnic medicine and food with good safety records, our findings 
propose that Lobaria extracts and DEPs have potential as neuroprotective and 
therapeutic agents for AD patients.

Given the increasing trend of aging population in the world, neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDDs), a common type of diseases that mostly occur in the elderly, 
have attracted much more attention. It has been shown that tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is involved in the regulation of 
neuroinflammation, an important pathological feature of NDDs, and affects the 
occurrence and development of NDDs. Most importantly, the regulatory effect of 
TRAF6 is related to its ubiquitination. Therefore, in the present paper, the 
molecular structure, biological function, and ubiquitination mechanism of TRAF6, 
and its relationship with some common NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, were 
analyzed and summarized. The possible molecular mechanisms by which TRAF6 
regulates the occurrence of NDDs were also elucidated, providing a theoretical 
basis for exploring the etiology and treatment of NDDs.

INTRODUCTION: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients undergoing cortical 
shunting frequently show early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology on cortical 
biopsy, which is predictive of progression to clinical AD. The objective of this 
study was to use samples from this cohort to identify cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) 
biomarkers for AD-related central nervous system (CNS) pathophysiologic changes 
using tissue and fluids with early pathology, free of post mortem artifact.
METHODS: We analyzed Simoa, proteomic, and metabolomic CSF data from 81 patients 
with previously documented pathologic and transcriptomic changes.
RESULTS: AD pathology on biopsy correlates with CSF β-amyloid-42/40, 
neurofilament light chain (NfL), and phospho-tau-181(p-tau181)/β-amyloid-42, 
while several gene expression modules correlate with NfL. Proteomic analysis 
highlights seven core proteins that correlate with pathology and gene expression 
changes on biopsy, and metabolomic analysis of CSF identifies disease-relevant 
groups that correlate with biopsy data.
DISCUSSION: As additional biomarkers are added to AD diagnostic panels, our work 
provides insight into the CNS pathophysiology these markers are tracking.
HIGHLIGHTS: AD CSF biomarkers correlate with CNS pathology and transcriptomic 
changes. Seven proteins correlate with CNS pathology and gene expression 
changes. Inflammatory and neuronal gene expression changes correlate with YKL-40 
and NPTXR, respectively. CSF metabolomic analysis identifies pathways that 
correlate with biopsy data. Fatty acid metabolic pathways correlate with 
β-amyloid pathology.

The diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) remains challenging, and 
existing therapeutic approaches demonstrate little efficacy. NDD drug delivery 
can be achieved through the utilization of nanostructures, hence enabling 
multimodal NDD theranostics. Nevertheless, both biomembrane and non-biomembrane 
nanostructures possess intrinsic shortcomings that must be addressed by 
hybridization to create novel nanostructures with versatile applications in NDD 
theranostics. Hybrid nanostructures display improved biocompatibility, inherent 
targeting capabilities, intelligent responsiveness, and controlled drug release. 
This paper provides a concise overview of the latest developments in hybrid 
nanostructures for NDD theranostics and emphasizes various engineering 
methodologies for the integration of diverse nanostructures, including 
liposomes, exosomes, cell membranes, and non-biomembrane nanostructures such as 
polymers, metals, and hydrogels. The use of a combination technique can 
significantly augment the precision, intelligence, and efficacy of hybrid 
nanostructures, therefore functioning as a more robust theranostic approach for 
NDDs. This paper also addresses the issues that arise in the therapeutic 
translation of hybrid nanostructures and explores potential future prospects in 
this field.

Transthyretin (TTR) is a tetrameric protein traditionally recognized for its 
role in transporting thyroxine and retinol. Recent research has highlighted the 
potential neuroprotective functions of TTR in the setting of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), which is the most common form of dementia and is caused by the deposition 
of amyloid beta (Aβ) and the resulting cytotoxic effects. This paper explores 
the mechanisms of TTR protective action, including its interaction with Aβ to 
prevent fibril formation and promote Aβ clearance from the brain. It also 
synthesizes experimental evidence suggesting that enhanced TTR stability may 
mitigate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. Potential therapeutic 
strategies such as small molecule stabilizers of TTR are discussed, highlighting 
their role in enhancing TTR binding to Aβ and facilitating its clearance. By 
consolidating current knowledge and proposing directions for future research, 
this review aims to underscore the significance of TTR as a neuroprotective 
factor in AD and the potential implications for future research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that dramatically 
affects cognitive abilities and represents the most common cause of dementia. 
Currently, pharmacological interventions represent the main treatment to deal 
with the symptoms of AD; however, alternative approaches are readily sought. 
Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation 
technique that uses short, repetitive shockwaves with the potential to provide a 
wide range of vascular, metabolic, and neurotrophic changes and that has 
recently been shown to improve cognitive abilities in AD. This exploratory study 
aims to gain insight into the neurophysiological effect of one session of TPS in 
AD as reflected in electroencephalographic measures, e.g., spectral power, 
coherence, Tsallis entropy (TE), and cross-frequency coupling (cfc). We document 
changes in power (frontal and occipital), coherence (frontal, occipital and 
temporal), and TE (temporal and frontal) as well as changes in cfc 
(parietal-frontal, parietal-temporal, frontal-temporal). Our results emphasize 
the role of electroencephalographic measures as prospective markers for the 
neurophysiological effect of TPS.

Therapeutics enhancing apolipoprotein (APOE) positive function are a priority, 
because APOE4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
function of APOE, the key constituent of lipoprotein particles that transport 
cholesterol and lipids in the brain, is dependent on lipidation by ABCA1, a 
cell-membrane cholesterol transporter. ABCA1 transcription is regulated by liver 
X receptors (LXR): agonists have been shown to increase ABCA1, often accompanied 
by unwanted lipogenesis and elevated triglycerides (TG). Therefore, nonlipogenic 
ABCA1-inducers (NLAI) are needed. Two rounds of optimization of an HTS hit, 
derived from a phenotypic screen, gave lead compound 39 that was validated and 
tested in E3/4FAD mice that express human APOE3/4 and five mutant APP and PSEN1 
human transgenes. Treatment with 39 increased ABCA1 expression, enhanced APOE 
lipidation, and reversed multiple AD phenotypes, without increasing TG. This 
NLAI/LXR-agonist study is the first in a human APOE-expressing model with 
hallmark amyloid-β pathology.

The intricacy and multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitate 
therapies that target multiple aspects of the disease. Mesenchymal stromal cells 
(MSCs) emerge as potential agents to mitigate AD symptoms; however, whether 
their therapeutic efficacy involves modulation of gut microbiota and the 
microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA) remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluated 
the effects of three distinct MSCs types-derived from the umbilical cord 
(UCMSC), dental pulp (SHED), and adipose tissue (ADSC)-in an APP/PS1 mouse model 
of AD. In comparison to saline control, MSCs administration resulted in a 
significant reduction of behavioral disturbances, amyloid plaques, and 
phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, accompanied by an 
increase in neuronal count and Nissl body density across AD-afflicted brain 
regions. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified partial restoration of 
gut microbial balance in AD mice post-MSCs treatment, evidenced by the elevation 
of neuroprotective Akkermansia and reduction of the AD-associated Sphingomonas. 
To examine whether gut microbiota involved in MSCs efficacy in treating AD, SHED 
with better anti-inflammatory and gut microbiota recovery effects among three 
MSCs, and another AD model 5 × FAD mice with earlier and more pathological 
proteins in brain than APP/PS1, were selected for further studies. 
Antibiotic-mediated gut microbial inactivation attenuated MSCs efficacy in 
5 × FAD mice, implicating the involvement of gut microbiota in the therapeutic 
mechanism. Functional analysis of altered gut microbiota and targeted bile acid 
metabolism profiling revealed a significant enhancement in bile acid variety 
following MSCs therapy. A chief bile acid constituent, taurocholic acid (TCA), 
was orally administered to AD mice and similarly abated AD symptoms. 
Nonetheless, the disruption of intestinal neuronal integrity with enterotoxin 
abrogated the ameliorative impact of both MSCs and TCA treatments. Collectively, 
our findings substantiate that MSCs confer therapeutic benefits in AD within a 
paradigm that primarily involves regulation of gut microbiota and their 
metabolites through the MGBA.

BACKGROUND: NOTCH3 encodes a transmembrane receptor critical for vascular smooth 
muscle cell function. NOTCH3 variants are the leading cause of hereditary 
cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). While monoallelic cysteine-involving 
missense variants in NOTCH3 are well-studied in cerebral autosomal dominant 
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), 
patients with biallelic variants in NOTCH3 are extremely rare and not well 
characterised.
METHODS: In this study, we present clinical and genetic data from 25 patients 
with biallelic NOTCH3 variants and conduct a literature review of another 25 
cases (50 patients in total). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were 
analysed by expert neuroradiologists to better understand the phenotype 
associated with biallelic NOTCH3 variants.
FINDINGS: Our systematic analyses verified distinct genotype-phenotype 
correlations for the two types of biallelic variants in NOTCH3. Biallelic 
loss-of-function variants (26 patients) lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder 
characterised by spasticity, childhood-onset stroke, and periatrial white matter 
volume loss resembling periventricular leukomalacia. Conversely, patients with 
biallelic cysteine-involving missense variants (24 patients) fall within CADASIL 
spectrum phenotype with early adulthood onset stroke, dementia, and deep white 
matter lesions without significant volume loss. White matter lesion volume is 
comparable between patients with biallelic cysteine-involving missense variants 
and individuals with CADASIL. Notably, monoallelic carriers of loss-of-function 
variants are predominantly asymptomatic, with only a few cases reporting 
nonspecific headaches.
INTERPRETATION: We propose a NOTCH3-SVD classification depending on dosage and 
variant type. This study not only expands our knowledge of biallelic NOTCH3 
variants but also provides valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms of 
the disease, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of 
NOTCH3-related SVD.

Viral vector mediated gene therapies for neurodegenerative and 
neurodevelopmental conditions that require neurosurgical administration continue 
to expand. We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo 
viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative 
and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies 
using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or 
intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international 
countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical 
trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that 
supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were 
aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene 
expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were 
identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A 
range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied 
with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, 
Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, 
Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. 
Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested 
therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and 
vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal 
delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery 
established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease results in neurodegeneration and is 
characterized by an accumulation of abnormal neuritic lesions and intracellular 
aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins in the cerebrum. That leads to 
progressive decline in memory, thinking, and learning skills. Oxidative stress 
has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease. Antioxidants are identified as part of therapeutic strategy to prevent 
or reduce the disease. Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of coenzyme Q10 with 
potent antioxidant properties, originally developed for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders. After oral administration 
idebenone undergoes excessive first-pass metabolism and has a very low 
bioavailability of only about 1%. The use of an alternative route of 
administration such as the nasal and its incorporation into a novel carrier 
(nanocomposite microspheres) will eliminate the problems associated with reduced 
absorption, stability, and rapid biotransformation and will increase the 
opportunity for idebenone to realize its therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's 
disease.
METHODS: Idebenone-loaded nanocomposite microspheres were obtained by spray 
drying. The structures were characterized using laser diffraction, scanning 
electron microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier-transform 
infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The ability of 
nanocomposite microspheres to bind human serum albumin was investigated by 
fluorescence spectroscopy. The mucoadhesive properties of the carrier were also 
determined.
RESULTS: Bioadhesive nanocomposite microparticles with spherical shape, smooth 
surface, size of 7.37 ± 2.4 μm, and with high production yield, good drug 
entrapment efficiency, and loading values were obtained. Infrared spectra 
demonstrated no chemical interactions between idebenone and structure-forming 
polymers. The ability of particles to bind to human serum albumin depends on 
their drug loading.
CONCLUSIONS: Nanocomposite microspheres were developed as the novel delivery 
system of idebenone for target nose-to-brain delivery. The obtained carrier may 
increase the therapeutic potential of idebenone by providing higher 
concentrations in brain tissue and reducing systemic exposure and side effects.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may have a disease-modifying effect in the 
development of Parkinson's disease (PD), but population studies yielded 
inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare the risk of PD associated with GLP-1RAs 
compared to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) among older adults with 
type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: Using U.S. Medicare administrative data from 2016 to 2020, we conducted 
a population-based cohort study comparing the new use of GLP-1RA with the new 
use of DPP4i among adults aged ≥66 years with T2D. The primary endpoint was a 
new diagnosis of PD. A stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(sIPTW)-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model was employed to 
estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PD between 
GLP-1RA and DPP4i users.
RESULTS: This study included 89,074 Medicare beneficiaries who initiated either 
GLP-1RA (n = 30,091) or DPP4i (n = 58,983). The crude incidence rate of PD was 
lower among GLP-1RA users than DPP4i users (2.85 vs. 3.92 patients per 1000 
person-years). An sIPTW-adjusted Cox model showed that GLP-1RA users were 
associated with a 23% lower risk of PD than DPP4i users (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 
0.63-0.95). Our findings were largely consistent across different subgroup 
analyses such as sex, race, and molecular structure of GLP-1RA.
CONCLUSION: Among Medicare beneficiaries with T2D, the new use of GLP-1RAs was 
significantly associated with a decreased risk of PD compared to the new use of 
DPP4i. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

The ketogenic diet (KD) is marked by a substantial decrease in carbohydrate 
intake and an elevated consumption of fats and proteins, leading to a metabolic 
state referred to as "ketosis," where fats become the primary source of energy. 
Recent research has underscored the potential advantages of the KD in mitigating 
the risk of various illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart 
disease, and cancer. The macronutrient distribution in the KD typically entails 
high lipid intake, moderate protein consumption, and low carbohydrate intake. 
Restricting carbohydrates to below 50 g/day induces a catabolic state, prompting 
metabolic alterations such as gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. Ketogenesis 
diminishes fat and glucose accumulation as energy reserves, stimulating the 
production of fatty acids. Neurodegenerative diseases, encompassing Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease are hallmarked by persistent neuroinflammation. 
Evolving evidence indicates that immune activation and neuroinflammation play a 
significant role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The protective effects 
of the KD are linked to the generation of ketone bodies (KB), which play a 
pivotal role in this dietary protocol. Considering these findings, this 
narrative review seeks to delve into the potential effects of the KD in 
neuroinflammation by modulating the immune response. Grasping the 
immunomodulatory effects of the KD on the central nervous system could offer 
valuable insights into innovative therapeutic approaches for these 
incapacitating conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Drug development for Alzheimer's disease has one of the greatest 
failure rates of any therapeutic field and AD is still incurable. Glycogen 
synthase kinase-3β is a critical enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, 
particularly in the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which leads to the 
formation of neurofibrillary tangles. TNF-α also plays a significant role in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by promoting neuroinflammation, contributing 
to the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, impairing 
synaptic function, and disrupting the balance of neurotrophic factors. 
Phytomedicine has numerous advantages over synthetic medications, acting 
multiple mode of action, including being less toxic and having fewer adverse 
effects. Flavonoids act as a promising therapeutic target for treating 
Alzheimer's disease. The present work investigates the anti-AD potentials of 35 
flavonoids for the inhibition of GSK-3β and TNF-α.
METHODS: The physicochemical, pharmacokinetic parameters, toxicity profile and 
drug-likeliness of the selected 35 flavonoids were predicted using SwissADME & 
OSIRIS data Warrier property explorer web tool. All flavonoids were selected for 
docking studies on GSK-3β and TNF-α protein using Autodock 4.2.1.
RESULTS: The predictions of this study suggested that among the selected 35 
flavonoids, Top 3 flavonoids, such as Epicatechin gallate -10.93 kcal/mol, 
Fisetin -9.44 kcal/mol and Eriodictyol -8.54 kcal/mol for GSK-3β targets. TNF-α 
Fisetin -11.52 kcal/mol, Sterubin -10.87 kcal/mol, Biochainin A 
-10.69 kcal/mol were compared with standard drug donepezil.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, these flavonoids could be utilized as possible leads for 
the structure-based design in the advancement of new, strong Anti-Alzheimer's 
agents. However, more invitro and invivo analyses are required to finally 
confirm the outcomes of this research.

BACKGROUND: Medications with sedative or anticholinergic properties should be 
prescribed with caution in those with cognitive complaints. This is particularly 
relevant in people ageing with an intellectual disability (ID). Higher drug 
burden index (DBI) scores are associated with increased frailty and falls and 
reduced quality of life in older people and increased risk of adverse effects 
(daytime somnolence, constipation) in those with ID. While previous studies have 
shown that the ID population has higher rates of drug burden and a higher 
propensity to be prescribed an antipsychotic than the general population, the 
degree of burden has not been assessed specifically in those with ID and 
cognitive complaints.
METHODS: We assessed drug burden in a cohort of sequential referrals to a 
national memory service for people with ID. All patients were referred for 
assessment of cognitive complaints (self-reported or caregiver-reported problems 
with memory or cognition). DBI was calculated individually for each participant, 
and the impact of aetiology of ID, level of ID, age, psychiatric/neurological 
comorbidities and diagnostic outcome on DBI scores was assessed.
RESULTS: The study population was 58.6% female with a median age of 55 years and 
aetiology of ID was Down syndrome (DS) in 71.3%. Consensus diagnosis was 
Alzheimer's dementia in 40.2%, mild cognitive impairment in 29.9% and 
cognitively unimpaired from baseline in 25.3%. Medication use was high with 
95.4% taking medications, with a median number of medications of 4 
(interquartile range 4) and a rate of polypharmacy (≥5 medications) of 51.7%. 
Overall, 65.5% were exposed to sedative or anticholinergic medications with 
39.1% exposed to a clinically significant DBI score >1. Those with psychiatric 
comorbidities, non-DS aetiology or epilepsy were significantly more likely to 
have a DBI score >1.
CONCLUSIONS: People with ID and incipient cognitive complaints have a high level 
of drug burden, which concerningly exceeds that of the general population.

BACKGROUND: Protein biomarkers have been broadly investigated in cerebrospinal 
fluid and blood for the detection of neurodegenerative diseases, yet a 
clinically useful diagnostic test to detect early, pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remains elusive. We conducted this study to quantify Aβ40, Aβ42, 
total Tau (t-Tau), hyperphosphorylated Tau (ptau181), glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in eye fluids relative to 
blood.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we collected vitreous humor, aqueous 
humor, tear fluid and plasma in patients undergoing surgery for eye disease. All 
six biomarkers were quantitatively measured by digital immunoassay. Spearman and 
Bland-Altman correlation analyses were performed to assess the agreement of 
levels between ocular fluids and plasma.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine adults underwent pars-plana vitrectomy in at least one 
eye. Of the 79, there were 77 vitreous, 67 blood, 56 tear fluid, and 51 aqueous 
samples. All six biomarkers were quantified in each bio-sample, except GFAP and 
NfL in tear fluid due to low sample volume. All six biomarkers were elevated in 
vitreous humor compared to plasma samples. T-Tau, ptau181, GFAP and NfL were 
higher in aqueous than in plasma, and t-Tau and ptau181 concentrations were 
higher in tear fluid than in plasma. Significant correlations were found between 
Aβ40 in plasma and tears (r = 0.5; p = 0.019), t-Tau in plasma and vitreous 
(r = 0.4; p = 0.004), NfL in plasma and vitreous (r = 0.3; p = 0.006) and plasma 
and aqueous (r = 0.5; p = 0.004). No significant associations were found for 
Aβ42, ptau181 and GFAP among ocular fluids relative to plasma. Bland-Altman 
analysis showed aqueous humor had the closest agreement to plasma across all 
biomarkers. Biomarker levels in ocular fluids revealed statistically significant 
associations between vitreous and aqueous for t-Tau (r = 0.5; p = 0.001), GFAP 
(r = 0.6; p < 0.001) and NfL (r = 0.7; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: AD biomarkers are detectable in greater quantities in eye fluids 
than in plasma and show correlations with levels in plasma. Future studies are 
needed to assess the utility of ocular fluid biomarkers as diagnostic and 
prognostic markers for AD, especially in those at risk with eye disease.

Proteomics can shed light on the dynamic and multifaceted alterations in 
neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Combining 
radioligands measuring β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles with cerebrospinal 
fluid proteomics, we uncover molecular events mirroring different stages of AD 
pathology in living humans. We found 127 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) 
across the AD spectrum. The strongest Aβ-related proteins were mainly expressed 
in glial cells and included SMOC1 and ITGAM. A dozen proteins linked to ATP 
metabolism and preferentially expressed in neurons were independently associated 
with tau tangle load and tau accumulation. Only 20% of the DAPs were also 
altered in other neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring AD's distinct 
proteome. Two co-expression modules related, respectively, to protein metabolism 
and microglial immune response encompassed most DAPs, with opposing, staggered 
trajectories along the AD continuum. We unveil protein signatures associated 
with Aβ and tau proteinopathy in vivo, offering insights into complex neural 
responses and potential biomarkers and therapeutics targeting different disease 
stages.

Heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic are prevalent in the 
environment due to both natural and anthropogenic sources, leading to 
significant public health concerns. These heavy metals are known to cause damage 
to the nervous system, potentially leading to a range of neurological conditions 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The present study examines the complex 
relationship between heavy metal exposure and AD, focusing on the underlying 
mechanisms of toxicity and potential therapeutic approaches. This review article 
highlights how these metals can impair brain function through mechanisms such as 
oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotransmitter disruption, ultimately 
contributing to neurodegenerative diseases like AD. It also addresses the 
challenges in diagnosing heavy metal-induced cognitive impairments and 
emphasizes the need for further research to explore effective treatment 
strategies and preventive measures against heavy metal exposure.

OBJECTIVES: Various dementia risk scores exist that assess different factors. We 
investigated the association between the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and 
Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score and modifiable risk factors in the Lifestyle 
for Brain Health (LIBRA) score in a German population at high risk of 
Alzheimer's disease.
METHOD: Baseline data of 807 participants of AgeWell.de (mean age: 68.8 years 
(SD = 4.9)) were analysed. Stepwise multivariable regression was used to examine 
the association between the CAIDE score and additional risk factors of the LIBRA 
score. Additionally, we examined the association between dementia risk models 
and cognitive performance, as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.
RESULTS: High cognitive activity (β = -0.016, p < 0.001) and high fruit and 
vegetable intake (β = -0.032, p < 0.001) correlated with lower CAIDE scores, 
while diabetes was associated with higher CAIDE scores (β = 0.191; p = 0.032). 
Although all were classified as high risk on CAIDE, 31.5% scored ≤0 points on 
LIBRA, indicating a lower risk of dementia. Higher CAIDE and LIBRA scores were 
associated with lower cognitive performance.
CONCLUSION: Regular cognitive activities and increased fruit and vegetable 
intake were associated with lower CAIDE scores. Different participants are 
classified as being at-risk based on the dementia risk score used.

IMPORTANCE: Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) is associated with 
increased risk for neurodegeneration. Accumulation of toxic proteins due to 
impaired brain clearance is suspected to play a role.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether perivascular space (PVS) volume is associated 
with lifetime exposure to RHI in individuals at risk for RHI-associated 
neurodegeneration.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was part of the 
Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and 
Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (DIAGNOSE CTE) Research Project, 
a 7-year multicenter study consisting of 4 US study sites. Data were collected 
from September 2016 to February 2020 and analyses were performed between May 
2021 and October 2023. After controlling for magnetic resonance image (MRI) and 
processing quality, former American football players and unexposed asymptomatic 
control participants were included in analyses.
EXPOSURE: Prior exposure to RHI while participating in American football was 
estimated using the 3 cumulative head impact indices (CHII-G, linear 
acceleration; CHII-R, rotational acceleration; and CHII, number of head 
impacts).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Individual PVS volume was calculated in the white 
matter of structural MRI. Cognitive impairment was based on neuropsychological 
assessment. Linear regression models were used to assess associations of PVS 
volume with neuropsychological assessments in former American football players. 
All analyses were adjusted for confounders associated with PVS volume.
RESULTS: Analyses included 224 participants (median [IQR] age, 57 [51-65] 
years), with 170 male former football players (114 former professional athletes, 
56 former collegiate athletes) and 54 male unexposed control participants. 
Former football players had larger PVS volume compared with the unexposed group 
(mean difference, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.00-0.56]; P = .05). Within the football group, 
PVS volume was associated with higher CHII-R (β = 2.71 × 10-8 [95% CI, 
0.50 × 10-8 to 4.93 × 10-8]; P = .03) and CHII-G (β = 2.24 × 10-6 [95% CI, 
0.35 × 10-6 to 4.13 × 10-6]; P = .03). Larger PVS volume was also associated 
with worse performance on cognitive functioning in former American football 
players (β = -0.74 [95% CI, -1.35 to -0.13]; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that impaired perivascular 
brain clearance, as indicated by larger PVS volume, may contribute to the 
association observed between RHI exposure and neurodegeneration.

Neurological disorders are the primary cause of human disability and mortality 
globally, however, current medications slightly alleviate some symptoms of 
degenerative diseases. Serine is an important amino acid for the brain function 
and involved in a variety of biosynthetic pathways and signal transduction 
processes. The imbalance of serine metabolism is associated with 
neurodegeneration, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. 
Altered activities of serine metabolizing enzymes and accumulation of serine 
metabolites affect the survival and function of nerve cells. Abnormal serine 
levels are observed in animal models with neurological diseases, but not all 
human studies, therefore, the maintenance of serine homeostasis is a potentially 
therapeutic strategy for neurological disorders. To date, physiological and 
pharmacological roles of serine in neurological diseases have not been 
systemically recapitulated, and the association between serine and neurological 
diseases is controversial. In this review, we summarize physicochemical 
properties of serine, biological processes of serine in the brain (source, 
biotransformation, and transport), and the application of serine in neurological 
diseases including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Here, we 
highlight physicochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and therapeutic potentials 
of serine in the prevention and treatment of neurological dysfunction. Our work 
provides valuable hints for future investigation that will lead to a 
comprehensive understanding of serine and its metabolism in cellular physiology 
and pharmacology. Although broad by necessity, the review helps researchers to 
understand great potentials of serine in the prevention and treatment of 
neurological dysfunction.

HYPOTHESIS: Memantine, an N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor antagonist, is widely 
used to treat Alzheimer's disease and has been found to have potential 
neuroprotective effects. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of 
memantine against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.
BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a widely used anticancer drug for various cancers; 
however, its use is limited by its side effects, including ototoxicity. Several 
drugs have been developed to reduce cisplatin toxicity. In this study, we 
treated cisplatin-damaged cochlear hair cells with memantine and evaluated its 
protective effects.
METHOD: House Ear Institute Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells and cochlear 
explants were treated with cisplatin or memantine. Cell viability, apoptotic 
patterns, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, Bcl-2/caspase-3 activity, 
and cell numbers were measured to evaluate the anti-apoptotic and antioxidative 
effects of memantine.
RESULT: Memantine treatment significantly improved cell viability and reduced 
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in auditory cells. Bcl-2/caspase-3 activity was also 
significantly increased, suggesting anti-apoptotic effects against 
cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that memantine protects against 
cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in vitro, providing a potential new strategy for 
preventing hearing loss in patients undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy.

The drainage of fluid and solutes along lymphatic pathways from the brain has 
been found to be impaired in mouse models of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's 
disease, and Parkinson's disease where neuroinflammation is present. We recently 
demonstrated that 3H-albumin, a model therapeutic protein (∼65 kDa), undergoes 
preferential lymphatic transport from the brain using a cervical lymph 
cannulation model in healthy rats. We thus hypothesized that neuroinflammation 
would impede the lymphatic transport of 3H-albumin from the brain. Our aim was 
to quantify the impact of acute neuroinflammation on drainage of the model 
therapeutic protein (3H-albumin) from the rat brain into blood and deep cervical 
lymph. To establish the required neuroinflammation model, male Sprague-Dawley 
rats were administered an intraperitoneal (IP) dose of 0.5-2 mg/kg 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli) or a saline control. After 12 or 24 
h, brain samples were collected and analyzed for concentrations of interferon 
gamma (IFN-γ) using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. 
The impact of neuroinflammation on the drainage of 3H-albumin from the brain was 
determined via IP administration of 2 mg/kg LPS or saline followed by 
cannulation of the carotid artery for blood collection 24 h later with/without 
cannulation or ligation at the efferent deep cervical lymph trunk. Rats were 
then administered 3H-albumin via direct injection into the brain striatum or via 
intravenous (IV) injection (lymph-intact group only). Blood ± lymph samples were 
collected for up to 8 h following dosing. At the end of the study, brain and 
lymph node samples were harvested for biodistribution analysis, with samples 
analyzed for radioactivity levels via scintillation counting. Brain 
concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ were only significantly 
elevated 24 h after IP administration of 2 mg/kg LPS compared to saline control. 
Therefore, this induction regimen was utilized for subsequent studies. The 
plasma concentrations of 3H-albumin over time were elevated in LPS-induced rats 
compared to saline-injected rats in the lymph-intact and lymph-ligated groups 
but not in the lymph-cannulated group. In the deep cervical lymph-cannulated 
animals, the lymph transport of 3H-albumin was not increased and appeared to be 
slower in the LPS-administered rats. Acute LPS-induced neuroinflammation 
therefore led to an enhanced overall transport of 3H-albumin from the brain into 
the systemic circulation. This appeared to be primarily due to increased 
transport of 3H-albumin from the brain directly into the blood circulation as 
3H-albumin transport from the brain via the lymphatics was not increased in the 
LPS-induced neuroinflammation model. Such changes in the clearance of 
therapeutic proteins from the brain in the setting of neuroinflammation may 
impact the therapeutic efficacy and safety.

BACKGROUND: Studies have examined the association between dual sensory 
impairment and late-life cognitive outcomes in the U.S with inconsistent 
findings.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between sensory impairment and 10-year 
risk of dementia or Alzheimer's disease among U.S. adults aged ≥ 50.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study based on the Health and Retirement Study 
from 2010 to 2020. Individuals aged ≥ 50 years without self-reported dementia 
and Alzheimer's disease in 2010 were included in the analysis. Self-reported 
visual and hearing impairments were measures in 2010. Main failure events 
included self-reported incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease over a 10-year 
follow-up period. Participants were categorized as having no visual or hearing 
impairment, visual impairment only, hearing impairment only, and dual sensory 
impairment. Fine-Gray competing risk regression model was applied to estimate 
the associations of sensory impairment with incident dementia and Alzheimer's 
disease, adjusted for demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and health 
conditions at baseline.
RESULTS: Of 20,248 identified individuals, 14.6% had visual impairment only, 
11.2% had hearing impairment only, and 9.1% had dual impairment at baseline. 
After adjusting for all covariates, dual sensory impairment was associated with 
higher risk of dementia (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.23-1.73) and Alzheimer's disease 
(HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.76). Visual impairment only was also associated with 
incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease among individuals <65 years.
CONCLUSION: Older adults in the U.S. with visual and hearing impairments 
simultaneously had a particularly greater risk of dementia and Alzheimer's 
disease, indicating the needs of targeted screening for timely treatment and 
further prevention of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

In recent years, there has been a drastic surge in neurological disorders with 
sporadic cases contributing more than ever to their cause. Radiation exposure 
through diagnostic or therapeutic routes often results in neurological injuries 
that may lead to neurodegenerative pathogenesis. However, the underlying 
mechanisms regulating the neurological impact of exposure to near-low doses of 
ionizing radiation are not known. In particular, the neurological changes caused 
by metabolomic reprogramming have not yet been elucidated. Hence, in the present 
study, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a single whole-body X-ray dose of 0.5 Gy, 
and 14 days post-treatment, the hippocampus was subjected to metabolomic 
analysis. The hippocampus of the irradiated animals showed significant 
alterations in 15 metabolites, which aligned with altered tyrosine, 
phenylalanine, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of 
unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, a multiomics interaction network 
comprising metabolomics and RNA sequencing data analysis provided insights into 
gene-metabolite interactions. Tyrosine metabolism was revealed to be the most 
altered, which was demonstrated by the interaction of several crucial genes and 
metabolites. The present study revealed the regulation of low-dose 
radiation-induced neurotoxicity at the metabolomic level and its implications 
for the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. The present study also provides 
novel insights into metabolomic pathways altered following near-low-dose IR 
exposure and its link with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease and Parkinson's disease.

The most prevalent cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive decline 
and accelerating memory loss characterize it. Alzheimer's disease advances 
sequentially, starting with preclinical stages, followed by mild cognitive 
and/or behavioral impairment, and ultimately leading to Alzheimer's disease 
dementia. In recent years, healthcare providers have been advised to make an 
earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's, prior to individuals developing Alzheimer's 
disease dementia. Regrettably, the identification of early-stage Alzheimer's 
disease in clinical settings can be arduous due to the tendency of patients and 
healthcare providers to disregard symptoms as typical signs of aging. Therefore, 
accurate and prompt diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is essential in order to 
facilitate the development of disease-modifying and secondary preventive 
therapies prior to the onset of symptoms. There has been a notable shift in the 
goal of the diagnosis process, transitioning from merely confirming the presence 
of symptomatic AD to recognizing the illness in its early, asymptomatic phases. 
Understanding the evolution of disease-modifying therapies and putting effective 
diagnostic and therapeutic management into practice requires an understanding of 
this concept. The outcomes of this study will enhance in-depth knowledge of the 
current status of Alzheimer's disease's diagnosis and treatment, justifying the 
necessity for the quest for potential novel biomarkers that can contribute to 
determining the stage of the disease, particularly in its earliest stages. 
Interestingly, latest clinical trial status on pharmacological agents, the 
nonpharmacological treatments such as behavior modification, exercise, and 
cognitive training as well as alternative approach on phytochemicals as 
neuroprotective agents have been covered in detailed.

Ebola virus (EBOV) is a life-threatening and virulent pathogen that kills 
approximately 90 percent of infected individuals. Nowadays, microRNAs (miRNAs) 
have become a promising option for more efficient screening, diagnosis, 
monitoring, and therapy of numerous diseases such as cancer, stroke, 
Alzheimer's, and viral infections. Recent studies have revealed the role of EBOV 
and host-encoded miRNAs in Ebola virus disease (EVD), opening an avenue for 
developing novel drugs against EVD and diagnostic panels for EBOV infection. 
EBOV-encoded miRNAs such as miR-VP-3p and miR-1-5p and anti-EBOV host cell 
miRNAs such as has-miR-150-3p, has-miR-103b and has-miR-145-3p might be a 
possible diagnostic biomarker or druggable targets. This paper highlights the 
importance of viral and cellular miRNAs in EBOV infection and EVD.

This case report discusses the use of intravenous (IV) ketamine as a potential 
therapeutic agent for early-onset dementia. A 56-year-old female with a 
diagnosis of early-onset dementia showed significant cognitive decline despite 
trying and failing several standard treatments such as memantine, donepezil, and 
rivastigmine. Given the promising results of ketamine in other neurological and 
psychiatric disorders, the patient underwent a series of IV ketamine infusions 
over a period of two months. Following treatment, there was a notable 
improvement in cognitive function, mood, and daily living activities. By the end 
of her treatments, the patient stated she had more mental clarity, increased 
focus, improved memory, and increased energy. This case highlights the potential 
use of ketamine as a novel treatment approach for early-onset dementia and 
warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials.

Neurodegenerative diseases, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, prion 
disease, and Huntington's disease, present a growing health concern as human 
life expectancy increases. Despite this, effective treatments to halt disease 
progression remain elusive due to various factors, including challenges in drug 
delivery across physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier and patient 
compliance issues leading to treatment discontinuation. In response, innovative 
treatment approaches leveraging noninvasive techniques with higher patient 
compliance are emerging as promising alternatives. This Review aims to 
synthesize current treatment options and the challenges encountered in managing 
neurodegenerative diseases, while also exploring innovative treatment 
modalities. Specifically, noninvasive strategies such as intranasal 
administration and nanosized drug delivery systems are gaining prominence for 
their potential to enhance treatment efficacy and patient adherence. Nanosized 
drug delivery systems, including liposomes, polymeric micelles, and 
nanoparticles, are evaluated within the context of outstanding studies. The 
advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are discussed, providing 
insights into their therapeutic potential and limitations. Through this 
comprehensive examination, this Review contributes to the ongoing discourse 
surrounding the development of effective treatments for neurodegenerative 
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Women are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
and the decline in estrogens post-menopause is thought of as a factor increasing 
this risk. Estradiol (E2) is important in supporting cholinergic neuronal 
integrity, and cholinergic functioning may be negatively impacted following the 
loss of E2 post-menopause. The use of exogenous E2 has been observed to enhance 
cholinergically mediated cognitive performance in healthy post-menopausal women, 
which indicates a potentially protective mechanism. However, E2 is often 
co-administered with progestin or progesterone to prevent endometrial 
proliferation. Progesterone/progestins have previously been shown to have a 
detrimental effect on E2-mediated biological and cognitive effects mediated by 
cholinergic systems in preclinical models, therefore the present study aimed to 
assess whether progesterone would modify the effect of E2 to influence cognition 
during cholinergic blockade.
METHODS: Twenty participants completed 3-months of oral E2 treatment with 
micronized progesterone (mPRO) or with placebo (PLC) in a repeated-measures 
within-subjects crossover design, in which they also completed five 
anticholinergic challenge days per hormone treatment condition. During the 
challenge participants were administered low or high doses of the nicotinic 
cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine, the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist 
scopolamine, or placebo. Following drug administration participants performed 
cognitive tests sensitive to cholinergic tone, assessing attention, episodic 
memory, and working memory.
RESULTS: Significant decrements were found on some tasks when participants were 
taking E2+mPRO compared to E2 alone. Specifically, under more challenging task 
conditions and larger anticholinergic doses, participants showed poorer 
performance on the Critical Flicker Fusion task and the Stroop test and 
responded more conservatively on the N-back working memory task. Other tasks 
showed no differences between treatments under cholinergic blockade.
DISCUSSION: The findings show that mPRO when taken in concert with E2, was 
detrimental to effortful cognitive performance, in the presence of cholinergic 
blockade. These results are important for assessing the impact of combined 
postmenopausal hormone treatment on cognitive performance that is dependent on 
cholinergic functioning after menopause.

AI-based mining of biomedical literature: Applications for drug repurposing for 
the treatment of dementia.

Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, 
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and others significantly affect 
individuals, their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. While there are 
no cures yet, researchers worldwide are actively working on the development of 
novel treatments that have the potential to slow disease progression, alleviate 
symptoms, and ultimately improve the overall health of patients. Huge volumes of 
new scientific information necessitate new analytical approaches for meaningful 
hypothesis generation. To enable the automatic analysis of biomedical data we 
introduced AGATHA, an effective AI-based literature mining tool that can 
navigate massive scientific literature databases, such as PubMed. The 
overarching goal of this effort is to adapt AGATHA for drug repurposing by 
revealing hidden connections between FDA-approved medications and a health 
condition of interest. Our tool converts the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers 
from PubMed into multidimensional space where each gene and health condition are 
represented by specific metrics. We implemented advanced statistical analysis to 
reveal distinct clusters of scientific terms within the virtual space created 
using AGATHA-calculated parameters for selected health conditions and genes. 
Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was employed for categorizing and 
predicting samples (122 diseases and 20889 genes) fitted to specific classes. 
Advanced statistics were employed to build a discrimination model and extract 
lists of genes specific to each disease class. Here we focus on drugs that can 
be repurposed for dementia treatment as an outcome of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Therefore, we determined dementia-associated genes statistically 
highly ranked in other disease classes. Additionally, we report a mechanism for 
detecting genes common to multiple health conditions. These sets of genes were 
classified based on their presence in biological pathways, aiding in selecting 
candidates and biological processes that are exploitable with drug repurposing.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most fatal and irreversible 
neurodegenerative diseases, which causes a huge emotional and financial burden 
on families and society. Despite the progress made with recent clinical use of 
inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and amyloid-β (Aβ) antibodies, the curative 
effects of AD treatment remain unsatisfactory, which is probably due to the 
complexity of pathogenesis and the multiplicity of therapeutic targets. Thus, 
modulating complex pathological networks could be an alternative approach to 
treat AD. Here, a neutrophil membrane-coated MOF nanozyme (denoted as 
Neu-MOF/Fla) is biomimetically engineered to disturb the malignant Aβ 
deposition-inflammation cycle and ameliorate the pathological network for 
effective AD treatment. Neu-MOF/Fla could recognize the pathological 
inflammatory signals of AD, and deliver the photo-triggered anti-inflammatory CO 
and MOF based hydrolytic nanozymes to the lesion area of the brain in a 
spontaneous manner. Based on the in vitro and in vivo studies, Neu-MOF/Fla 
significantly suppresses neuroinflammation, mitigates the Aβ burden, 
beneficially modulates the pro-inflammatory microglial phenotypes and improves 
the cognitive defects of AD mice models. Our work presents a good example for 
developing biomimetic multifunctional nanotherapeutics against AD by means of 
amelioration of multiple symptoms and improvement of cognitive defects.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are no effective treatments targeting these 
symptoms.
METHODS: To facilitate identification of causative mechanistic pathways, we 
initiated an effort (NIH: U01AG079850) to collate, harmonize, and analyze all 
available NPS data (≈ 100,000 samples) of diverse ancestries with whole-genome 
sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).
RESULTS: This study will generate a genomic resource for Alzheimer's disease 
with both harmonized whole-genome sequencing and NPS phenotype data that will be 
publicly available through NIAGADS. Primary analyses will (1) identify novel 
genetic risk factors associated with NPS in AD, (2) characterize the shared 
genetic architecture of NPS in AD and primary psychiatric disorders, and (3) 
assess the role of ancestry effects in the etiology of NPS in AD.
DISCUSSION: Expansion of the ADSP to harmonize and refine NPS phenotypes coupled 
with the proposed core analyses will lay the foundation to disentangle the 
molecular mechanisms underlying these detrimental symptoms in AD in diverse 
populations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).There are no effective treatments targeting NPS in AD.The current 
effort aims to collate, harmonize, and analyze all NPS data from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Sequencing Project.Core analyses will identify underlying genetic 
factors and mechanistic pathways.The harmonized genomic and phenotypic data from 
this initiative will be available through National Institute on Aging Genetics 
of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site.

Amino acid derivatives are molecules of interest for medicinal chemistry and 
drug design studies due to their important chemical properties. In this study, 
the inhibition effects of some non-proteinogenic amino acid derivatives 
(hippuric acid (A), N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-D-valine (B), 
N-Z-(1-Benzotriazolylcarbonyl) methylamine (C), 
(S)-N-Z-1-Benzotriazolylcarbonyl-2-phenylethylamine (D)) on carbonic anhydrase I 
(hCA-I), II (hCA-II) isoenzymes and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, whose 
inhibitors are of vital pharmacological importance, were examined. While 
carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors are effective molecule candidates for the 
treatment of many diseases from glaucoma to cancer, acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors are target molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
According to the results of this study, compound D had a strong inhibitory 
effect on hCA-I (IC50: 0.836 μM) and hCA-II (IC50: 0.661 μM), while compound B 
(IC50: 100 μM) showed a strong inhibitory effect on AChE activity. In addition, 
inhibition results were supported by molecular modeling studies. We hope that 
the obtained results will contribute to the synthesis of new and effective amino 
acid derivative inhibitors for CA and AChE.

Alzheimer disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, and its 
pathogenesis involves various mechanisms such as neuroinflammation and β-amyloid 
deposition. Erjing Pills can inhibit neuroinflammation by inhibiting toll-like 
receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa-B/nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat 
and pyrin domain-containing protein 3; however, qualitative analysis of the 
material basis is lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and explore the 
material basis of network pharmacology research. This study employed a 
multifaceted approach, including drug-like screening, molecular docking, and 
bioinformatic analysis. Preliminary screening identified 59 drug ingredients in 
Erjing Pills that met the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and 
Toxicity screening criteria. Among these, 7 ingredients, including diosgenin, 
exhibited superior binding properties compared with the positive drugs in 
molecular docking. Gene ontology annotation and pathway analysis revealed their 
involvement in crucial biological processes, such as hormone response, insulin 
resistance, and steroid hormone biosynthesis signaling pathways, which are known 
for their anti-inflammatory and cognitive enhancement effects. A meta-analysis 
of relevant literature corroborated the anti-inflammatory activities of 
diosgenin and 5 other ingredients. These 5 ingredients, with diosgenin as a 
prominent candidate, exert anti-inflammatory effects by targeting key components 
of the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa-B/nucleotide-binding domain 
leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 inflammatory pathway, 
thereby presenting potential efficacy in the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.

BACKGROUND: The impact of thyroid function on the risk of various types of 
dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), remains 
unclear. This meta-analysis investigates the association between thyroid 
dysfunction and the risk of these dementia types, aiming to inform strategies 
for dementia prevention.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the 
Cochrane Library for studies published up to February 2023, focusing on the risk 
of thyroid dysfunction in dementia. We excluded duplicates, studies without full 
text, those with incomplete data, animal studies, case reports, and reviews. 
Data analysis was performed using STATA 15.1 software.
RESULTS: Our analysis indicated that overt hyperthyroidism significantly 
increases the risk of all studied dementia types (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.35). 
In contrast, overt hypothyroidism was associated with a decreased risk of AD 
(OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.98) and VD (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62-0.82). 
Subclinical hyperthyroidism also showed a significant association with an 
increased risk of any dementia (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.09-1.46) and specifically 
VD (OR = 6.70; 95% CI: 1.38-32.58).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that overt hypothyroidism may reduce the risk of 
dementia, including AD and VD, whereas overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism are 
linked to an increased risk. These findings highlight the importance of 
monitoring thyroid function as a preventative measure against dementia.

BACKGROUND: Antenatal steroid therapy for fetal lung maturation is routinely 
administered to women at risk of preterm delivery. There is strong evidence to 
demonstrate benefit from antenatal steroids in terms of survival and respiratory 
disease, notably in infants delivered at or below 32 weeks' gestation. However, 
dosing remains unoptimized and lung benefits are highly variable. Current 
treatment regimens generate high-concentration, pulsatile fetal steroid 
exposures now associated with increased risk of childhood neurodevelopmental 
diseases. We hypothesized that damage-associated changes in the fetal 
hippocampal transcriptome would be independent of preterm lung function.
METHODS: Date-mated ewes carrying a single fetus at 122 ± 2dGA (term = 150dGA) 
were randomized into 4 groups: (i) Saline Control Group, 4×2ml maternal saline 
intramuscular(IM) injections at 12hr intervals (n = 11); or (ii) Dex High Group, 
2×12mg maternal IM dexamethasone phosphate injections at 12hr intervals followed 
by 2×2ml IM saline injections at 12hr intervals (n = 12; representing a clinical 
regimen used in Singapore); or (iii) Dex Low Group, 4×1.5mg maternal IM 
dexamethasone phosphate injections 12hr intervals (n = 12); or (iv) Beta-Acetate 
Group, 1×0.125mg/kg maternal IM betamethasone acetate injection followed by 
3×2ml IM sterile normal saline injections 12hr intervals (n = 8). Lambs were 
surgically delivered 48hr after first maternal injection at 122-125dGA, 
ventilated for 30min to establish lung function, and euthanised for necropsy and 
tissue collection.
RESULTS: Preterm lambs from the Dex Low and Beta-Acetate Groups had 
statistically and biologically significant lung function improvements (measured 
by gas exchange, lung compliance). Compared to the Saline Control Group, 
hippocampal transcriptomic data identified 879 differentially significant 
expressed genes (at least 1.5-fold change and FDR < 5%) in the steroid-treated 
groups. Pulsatile dexamethasone-only exposed groups (Dex High and Dex Low) had 
three common positively enriched differentially expressed pathways related in 
part to neurodegeneration ("Prion Disease", "Alzheimer's Disease", "Arachidonic 
Acid metabolism"). Adverse changes were independent of respiratory function 
during ventilation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that exposure to antenatal steroid therapy is an 
independent cause of damage- associated transcriptomic changes in the brain of 
preterm, fetal sheep. These data highlight an urgent need for careful 
reconsideration and balancing of how antenatal steroids are used, both for 
patient selection and dosing regimens.

The underlying mechanisms of diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) 
remain unclear, limiting the development of effective therapeutic strategies. 
Remarkably, cellular senescence, a biological phenomenon observed in cultured 
fibroblasts in vitro, is a crucial intrinsic mechanism that influences 
homeostasis of the brain microenvironment and contributes to the onset and 
progression of CNS diseases. Cellular senescence has been observed in disease 
models established in vitro and in vivo and in bodily fluids or tissue 
components from patients with CNS diseases. These findings highlight cellular 
senescence as a promising target for preventing and treating CNS diseases. 
Consequently, emerging novel therapies targeting senescent cells have exhibited 
promising therapeutic effects in preclinical and clinical studies on 
aging-related diseases. These innovative therapies can potentially delay brain 
cell loss and functional changes, improve the prognosis of CNS diseases, and 
provide alternative treatments for patients. In this study, we examined the 
relevant advancements in this field, particularly focusing on the targeting of 
senescent cells in the brain for the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative 
diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple 
sclerosis) and acute neurotraumatic insults (e.g., ischemic stroke, spinal cord 
injury, and traumatic brain injury).

Alterations in the gut-microbiome-brain axis are increasingly being recognized 
to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the functional 
consequences of enteric dysbiosis linking gut microbiota and brain pathology in 
AD progression remain largely undetermined. The present work investigated the 
causal role of age-associated temporal decline in butyrate-producing bacteria 
and butyrate in the etiopathogenesis of AD. Longitudinal metagenomics, 
neuropathological, and memory analyses were performed in the 3×Tg-AD mouse 
model. Metataxonomic analyses showed a significant temporal decline in the alpha 
diversity marked by a decrease in butyrate-producing bacterial communities and a 
concurrent reduction in cecal butyrate production. Inferred metagenomics 
analysis identified the bacterial acetyl-CoA pathway as the main butyrate 
synthesis pathway impacted. Concomitantly, there was an age-associated decline 
in the transcriptionally permissive acetylation of histone 3 at lysines 9 and 14 
(H3K9/K14-Ac) in hippocampal neurons. Importantly, these microbiome-gut-brain 
changes preceded AD-related neuropathology, including oxidative stress, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, memory deficits, and neuromuscular dysfunction, which 
manifest by 17-18 months. Initiation of oral administration of tributyrin, a 
butyrate prodrug, at 6 months of age mitigated the age-related decline in 
butyrate-producing bacteria, protected the H3K9/K14-Ac status, and attenuated 
the development of neuropathological and cognitive changes associated with AD 
pathogenesis. These data causally implicate age-associated decline in 
butyrate-producing bacteria as a key pathogenic feature of the 
microbiome-gut-brain axis affecting the onset and progression of AD. 
Importantly, the regulation of butyrate-producing bacteria and consequent 
butyrate synthesis could be a significant therapeutic strategy in the prevention 
and treatment of AD.

Speech-language therapists/pathologists (SLT/Ps) are key professionals in the 
management and treatment of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), however, there 
are gaps in education and training within the discipline, with implications for 
skills, confidence, and clinical decision-making. This survey aimed to explore 
the areas of need amongst SLT/Ps working with people living with PPA (PwPPA) 
internationally to upskill the current and future workforce working with 
progressive communication disorders. One hundred eighty-six SLT/Ps from 27 
countries who work with PwPPA participated in an anonymous online survey about 
their educational and clinical experiences, clinical decision-making, and 
self-reported areas of need when working with this population. Best practice 
principles for SLT/Ps working with PwPPA were used to frame the latter two 
sections of this survey. Only 40.7% of respondents indicated that their 
university education prepared them for their current work with PwPPA. Competency 
areas of "knowing people deeply," "practical issues," "connectedness," and 
"preventing disasters" were identified as the basic areas of priority and need. 
Respondents identified instructional online courses (92.5%), sample tools and 
activities for interventions (64.8%), and concrete training on providing care 
for advanced stages and end of life (58.3%) as central areas of need in their 
current work. This is the first international survey to comprehensively explore 
the perspectives of SLT/Ps working with PwPPA. Based on survey outcomes, there 
is a pressing need to enhance current educational and ongoing training 
opportunities to better promote the well-being of PwPPA and their families, and 
to ensure appropriate preparation of the current and future SLT/P workforce.

OBJECTIVE: Studies have shown that electroacupuncture (EA) can alleviate 
cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease (AD) by regulating the expression 
of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but the specific 
mechanism involved remains to be elucidated. Therefore, this study explores the 
potential mechanism by which EA improves cognitive function from the perspective 
of mitochondrial dynamics.
METHODS: The four-month-old transgenic mice with amyloid precursor protein 
(APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) and AMPKα1-subunit conditional knockout (AMPKα1-cKO) 
were used for experiments. To evaluate the effects of EA treatment on cognitive 
function, the T-maze and Morris water maze were used. In addition, chemical 
exchange saturation transfer, thioflavin staining, transmission electron 
microscopy, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Western blotting were used to 
examine the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of EA on APP/PS1 mice.
RESULTS: Both APP/PS1 mice and AMPKα1-cKO mice exhibited dysfunction in 
mitochondrial dynamics accompanied by learning and memory impairment. 
Inactivation of the AMPK/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ 
coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) pathway increased pathological amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition 
and aggravated the dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics. In addition, EA 
rescued learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice by activating the 
AMPK/PGC-1α pathway, specifically by reducing pathological Aβ deposition, 
normalizing energy metabolism, protecting the structure and function of 
mitochondria, increasing the levels of mitochondrial fusion proteins, and 
downregulating the expression of fission proteins. However, the therapeutic 
effect of EA on cognition in APP/PS1 mice was hindered by AMPKα1 knockout.
CONCLUSION: The regulation of hippocampal mitochondrial dynamics and reduction 
in Aβ deposition via the AMPK/PGC-1α pathway are critical for the ability of EA 
to ameliorate cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Please cite this article as:

Neurofilaments (NFs), major cytoskeletal constituents of neurons, have emerged 
as universal biomarkers of neuronal injury. Neuroaxonal damage underlies 
permanent disability in various neurological conditions. It is crucial to 
accurately quantify and longitudinally monitor this damage to evaluate disease 
progression, evaluate treatment effectiveness, contribute to novel treatment 
development, and offer prognostic insights. Neurofilaments show promise for this 
purpose, as their levels increase with neuroaxonal damage in both cerebrospinal 
fluid and blood, independent of specific causal pathways. New assays with high 
sensitivity allow reliable measurement of neurofilaments in body fluids and open 
avenues to investigate their role in neurological disorders. This book chapter 
will delve into the evolving landscape of neurofilaments, starting with their 
structure and cellular functions within neurons. It will then provide a 
comprehensive overview of their broad clinical value as biomarkers in diseases 
affecting the central or peripheral nervous system.

Numerous academic literature suggests that amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, tau 
protein phosphorylation, and irreversible neuronal death are the three major 
causes of AD. The chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) protein family not only 
regulates the polarisation of neurons, but also has important implications for 
neuronal survival. Chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) can be 
pathologically activated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which causes a 
significant increase in the expression of CLIC4 and mediates neuronal apoptosis. 
CLIC4 knockdown inhibits H2O2-induced neuronal apoptosis; however, the 
relationship between CLIC4 and AD remains unknown. In the present study, we 
showed that CLIC4 expression was elevated in the hippocampus of AD mice; 
knockdown of hippocampal CLIC4 alleviated Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment 
in mice; overexpression of hippocampal CLIC4 accelerated Aβ deposition and tau 
protein hyperphosphorylation in young AD mice (APP/PS1 mice at three months of 
age). CLIC4 overexpressing mice had a longer escape latency compared to controls 
in behavioural testing (Morris water maze and T-maze tests). By 
Co-immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry (Co-IP/MS) of HT22 cells to identify 
proteins that specifically bind to CLIC4, we found interactions with CCAAT 
enhancer binding protein (C/EBPβ); a critical pathway involved in the 
development of various neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the knockdown of 
hippocampal CLIC4 alleviated AD-like pathology by inhibiting the C/EBPβ/AEP 
signaling pathway. These data suggest an essential role for high CLIC4 
expression in the pathophysiology of AD and reveal that inhibition of CLIC4 
expression may provide an opportunity for treatment.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition characterized by immune cell 
infiltration and cytokine overproduction that led to myelin sheath inflammatory 
assaults, thus causing axonal destruction. The former consequently provokes 
motor impairment and psychological disorders. Markedly, depression is one of the 
most prevalent lifelong comorbidities that negatively impacts the quality of 
life in MS patients. Vortioxetine (VTX), a multi-modal molecule prescribed to 
manage depression and anxiety disorder, additionally, it displays a promising 
neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. To this end, the present study investigated the 
potential therapeutic efficacy of VTX against experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS in mice. Notably, treatment with VTX 
significantly ameliorated EAE-induced motor disability, as evident by enhanced 
performance in open field, rotarod and grip strength tests, alongside a 
reduction in immobility time during the forced swimming test, indicating a 
mitigation of the depressive-like behavior; outcomes that were corroborated with 
histological examinations and biochemical analyses. Mechanistically, VTX 
enhanced serotonin levels by inhibiting both serotonin transporter (SERT) and 
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme, thereby promoting the activation of 
serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor. The latter triggered the stimulation of 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) cascade that entailed 
activation/phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). This 
activation increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and myelin basic 
protein (MBP) contents that mitigated demyelination in the corpus callosum. 
Furthermore, VTX suppressed phospho serine 536 nuclear factor kappa B (pS536 
NF-κB p65) activity and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production. 
The results underscore VTX's beneficial effects on disease severity in EAE model 
of MS in mice by amending both inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of 
MS progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains of unknown etiology and lacks a cure. This 
study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a novel bithiophene 
derivative at two doses against AlCl3-induced AD in a rat model. Adult male rats 
(Rattus norvegicus) were divided into six groups (n=6): Group one consisted of 
naïve animals, group two received bithiophene (1 mg/kg) every other day for 30 
days, and groups 3-6 were subjected to AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, equivalent to 20.23 mg 
Al3+) for 45 consecutive days. Groups four and five received low (0.5 mg/kg) or 
high (1 mg/kg) doses of bithiophene, respectively. Group six received memantine 
(20 mg/kg) daily for 30 days. All treatments were administered orally. Aluminum 
exposure resulted in severe degeneration of both histological and 
ultrastructural aspects of cells. Administration of the low dose of bithiophene 
significantly restored the number of CA1 pyramidal cells and the thickness of 
the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus. However, the high dose of 
bithiophene increased viable CA1 pyramidal cell numbers significantly without 
restoring the thickness of the stratum granulosum or reducing vacuolization or 
pyknotic changes. The low dose of bithiophene restored the normal histological 
and cytological structure of both cortical and hippocampal neurons affected by 
dementia. Further investigation is required to explore the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the ameliorative effects on Alzheimer's disease-induced 
deteriorations in the cortex and hippocampus.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease mainly characterized by 
cognitive impairment. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β) is a potential 
therapeutic target against AD. Isoorientin (ISO), a GSK3β substrate competitive 
inhibitor, plays anti-AD effects in in vitro and in vivo AD model. TFGF-18 is an 
ISO synthetic analog with improved potency, but its neuroprotective effect in 
vivo remains to be elucidated, and the underlying mechanisms of GSK3β inhibitor 
against AD need to be clarified. This study investigated the TFGF-18 and ISO 
effects on gut homeostasis and neuroinflammation in scopolamine (SCOP)-induced 
AD mice. And the protection on barrier function was observed in in vitro 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) model of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells 
(bEnd.3). The results show that TFGF-18 and ISO improved cognitive function in 
SCOP-induced mice, and inhibited cholinergic system disorders and inflammation 
in the brain and intestine, decreased the level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in 
serum and intestine, protected the diversity and balance of intestinal 
microbiome, increased the expressions of tight junction protein (ZO-1, 
occludin), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell-derived 
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the mouse brain and intestine. In addition, 
TFGF-18 and ISO protected against barrier damage in LPS-stimulated BBB model of 
bEnd.3 cells in vitro. TFGF-18 and ISO increased the ratio of p-GSK3β/GSK3β, 
suppressed toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4) expression and nuclear factor kappa-B 
(NF-κB) activation in vivo and in vitro, and increased the expressions of 
β-catenin, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme 
oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in vitro. In conclusion, The GSK3β inhibitors TFGF-18 and ISO 
modulate the gut homeostasis and barrier function to inhibit neuroinflammation 
and attenuate cognitive impairment by regulating NF-κB, β-catenin and Nrf2/HO-1 
pathways.

Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable conditions that lead to gradual and 
progressive deterioration of brain function in patients. With the aging 
population, the prevalence of these diseases is expected to increase, posing a 
significant economic burden on society. Imaging techniques play a crucial role 
in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. This study 
utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal 
relationship between different imaging-derived phenotypes (IDP) in the brain and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple MR methods were employed to minimize bias 
and obtain reliable estimates of the potential causal relationship between the 
variable exposures of interest and the outcomes. The study found potential 
causal relationships between different IDPs and Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple 
sclerosis (MS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Specifically, the study 
identified potential causal relationships between 2 different types of IDPs and 
AD, 8 different types of IDPs and PD, 11 different types of imaging-derived 
phenotypes and ALS, 1 type of IDP and MS, and 1 type of IDP and FTD. This study 
provides new insights for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases, offering important clues for understanding the 
pathogenesis of these diseases and developing relevant intervention strategies.

Statins are among the most widely used drugs for the inhibition of cholesterol 
biosynthesis, prevention of cardiovascular diseases, and treatment of 
hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, statins also exhibit cholesterol-independent 
benefits in various diseases, including neuroprotective properties in 
Alzheimer's disease, anti-inflammatory effects in coronary artery disease, and 
antiproliferative activities in cancer, which likely result from the statins' 
interaction and alteration of lipid bilayers. However, the membrane-modulatory 
effects of statins and the mechanisms by which statins alter lipid bilayers 
remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore the membrane-modulating 
effects of statins on model lipid bilayers and live cells. Through the use of 
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) combined with 
viscosity-sensitive environmental probes, we demonstrate that hydrophobic, but 
not hydrophilic, statins are capable of changing the microviscosity and lipid 
order in model and live cell membranes. Furthermore, we show that hydrophobic 
simvastatin is capable of forming nanoscale cholesterol-rich domains and 
homogenizing the cholesterol concentrations in lipid bilayers. Our results 
provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the bimodal effects of 
simvastatin on the lipid order and the lateral organization of cholesterol in 
lipid bilayers. Finally, we demonstrate that simvastatin temporarily decreases 
the microviscosity of live cell plasma membranes, making them more permeable and 
increasing the level of intracellular chemotherapeutic drug accumulation.

Neuronal survival depends on neurotrophins and their receptors. There are two 
types of neurotrophin receptors: a nonenzymatic, trans-membrane protein of the 
tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family-p75 receptor and the tyrosine 
kinase receptors (TrkR) A, B, and C. Activation of the TrkBR by brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5) promotes neuronal 
survival, differentiation, and synaptic function. It is shown that in the 
pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative conditions (Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease) the BDNF/TrkBR signaling pathway is 
impaired. Since it is known that GPCRs and TrkR are regulating several cell 
functions by interacting with each other and generating a cross-communication in 
this review we have focused on the interaction between different GPCRs and their 
ligands on BDNF/TrkBR signaling pathway.

The NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) 
inflammasome is a key component of the innate immune system that triggers 
inflammation and pyroptosis and contributes to the development of several 
diseases. Therefore, blocking the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has 
therapeutic potential for the treatment of these diseases. MCC950, a selective 
small molecule inhibitor, has emerged as a promising candidate for blocking 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Ongoing research is focused on elucidating the 
specific targets of MCC950 as well as assessfing its metabolism and safety 
profile. This review discusses the diseases that have been studied in relation 
to MCC950, with a focus on stroke, Alzheimer's disease, liver injury, 
atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and sepsis, using bibliometric analysis. It 
then summarizes the potential pharmacological targets of MCC950 and discusses 
its toxicity. Furthermore, it traces the progression from preclinical to 
clinical research for the treatment of these diseases. Overall, this review 
provides a solid foundation for the clinical therapeutic potential of MCC950 and 
offers insights for future research and therapeutic approaches.

Objective: The current study examined the longitudinal relationship between 
cognitive reserve (CR), depression, and executive function (EF) in a cohort of 
older adults. Methods: 416 participants were selected from the Wisconsin 
Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention. They were native English speakers, aged 
≥50+, and cognitively unimpaired at baseline, with no history of neurological or 
other psychiatric disorders aside from depression. Depression was assessed with 
the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). A 
composite score, based on the premorbid IQ (WRAT-3 Reading subtest) and years of 
education was used to estimate CR. Another composite score from four cognitive 
tests was used to estimate EF. A moderation analysis was performed to evaluate 
the effects of CR and Depression on EF at follow-up after controlling for age, 
gender, and APOE risk score. Moreover, a multinomial logistic regression was 
used to predict conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from the healthy 
baseline. Results: The negative relationship between depression and EF was 
stronger in individuals with higher CR levels, suggesting a possible floor 
effect at lower CR levels. In the multinomial regression, the interaction 
between CR and depression predicted conversion to MCI status, indicating that 
lower CR paired with more severe depression at baseline was associated with a 
higher risk of subsequent impairment. Conclusions: This study sheds light on the 
intricate relationship between depression and EF over time, suggesting that the 
association may be influenced by varying levels of CR. Further studies may 
replicate these findings in clinical populations.

Microglia, traditionally regarded as innate immune cells in the brain, drive 
neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunctions in the early phases of Alzheimer 
disease (AD), acting upstream to Aβ accumulation. Colony stimulating factor 
1-receptor (CSF-1R) is predominantly expressed on microglia and its levels are 
significantly increased in neurodegenerative diseases, possibly contributing to 
the chronic inflammatory microglial response. On the other hand, CSF-1R 
inhibitors confer neuroprotection in preclinical models of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Here, we determined the effects of the CSF-1R inhibitor PLX3397 on the 
Aβ-mediated synaptic alterations in ex vivo hippocampal slices. 
Electrophysiological findings show that PLX3397 rescues LTP impairment and 
neurotransmission changes induced by Aβ. In addition, using confocal imaging 
experiments, we demonstrate that PLX3397 stimulates a microglial transition 
toward a phagocytic phenotype, which in turn promotes the clearance of Aβ from 
glutamatergic terminals. We believe that the selective pruning of Aβ-loaded 
synaptic terminals might contribute to the restoration of LTP and excitatory 
transmission alterations observed upon acute PLX3397 treatment. This result is 
in accordance with the mechanism proposed for CSF1R inhibitors, that is to 
eliminate responsive microglia and replace it with newly generated, homeostatic 
microglia, capable of promoting brain repair. Overall, our findings identify a 
connection between the rapid microglia adjustments and the early synaptic 
alterations observed in AD, possibly highlighting a novel disease-modifying 
target.

Safely and efficiently controlling gene expression is a long-standing goal of 
biomedical research, and CRISPR/Cas system can be harnessed to create powerful 
tools for epigenetic editing. Adeno-associated-viruses (AAVs) represent the 
delivery vehicle of choice for therapeutic platform. However, their small 
packaging capacity isn't suitable for large constructs including most 
CRISPR/dCas9-effector vectors. Thus, AAV-based CRISPR/Cas systems have been 
delivered via two separate viral vectors. Here we develop a compact 
CRISPR/dCas9-based repressor system packaged in AAV as a single optimized 
vector. The system comprises the small Staphylococcus aureus (Sa)dCas9 and an 
engineered repressor molecule, a fusion of MeCP2's transcription repression 
domain (TRD) and KRAB. The dSaCas9-KRAB-MeCP2(TRD) vector platform repressed 
robustly and sustainably the expression of multiple genes-of-interest, in vitro 
and in vivo, including ApoE, the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset 
Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Our platform broadens the CRISPR/dCas9 toolset 
available for transcriptional manipulation of gene expression in research and 
therapeutic settings.

Long COVID-19 affects a significant percentage of patients and is characterized 
by a wide range of symptoms, including weariness and mental fog as well as 
emotional symptoms like worry and sadness. COVID-19 is closely linked to the 
autoimmune disorders that are becoming more prevalent worldwide and are linked 
to immune system hyperactivation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) 
development, and molecular mimicry pathways. Long-term COVID-related autoimmune 
responses include a watchful immune system referring to the ability of immune 
system to constantly monitor the body for signs of infection, disease, or 
abnormal cells; altered innate and adaptive immune cells, autoantigens secreted 
by living or dead neutrophils, and high concentrations of autoantibodies 
directed against different proteins. The microbiome, which consists of billions 
of bacteria living in the human body, is essential for controlling immune 
responses and supporting overall health. The microbiome can affect the course of 
long COVID-associated autoimmunity, including the degree of illness, the rate of 
recovery, and the onset of autoimmune reactions. Although the precise role of 
the microbiome in long COVID autoimmunity is still being investigated, new 
studies indicate that probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary changes-interventions 
that target the microbiome-may be able to reduce autoimmune reactions and 
enhance long-term outcomes for COVID-19 survivors. More research is required to 
precisely understand how the microbiome affects COVID-19-related autoimmunity 
and to create tailored treatment plans.

With full FDA approval and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services coverage of 
lecanemab and donanemab, a growing number of practices are offering anti-amyloid 
immunotherapy to appropriate patients with cognitive impairment or mild dementia 
due to amyloid-positive Alzheimer disease. The goal of this article is to 
provide updated practical considerations for radiologists, including 
implementation of MR imaging protocols, workflows, and reporting and 
communication practices relevant to anti-amyloid immunotherapy and monitoring 
for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). On the basis of consensus 
discussion within an expanded American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) 
Alzheimer, ARIA, and Dementia Study Group, our purpose is the following: 1) 
summarize the FDA guidelines for the evaluation of radiographic ARIA; 2) review 
the 3 key MRI sequences for ARIA monitoring and standardized imaging protocols 
on the basis of ASNR-industry collaborations; 3) provide imaging recommendations 
for 3 key patient scenarios; 4) highlight the role of the radiologist in the 
care team for this population; 5) discuss implementation of MRI protocols to 
detect ARIA in diverse practice settings; and 6) present the results of the 2023 
ASNR international neuroradiologist practice survey on dementia and ARIA 
imaging.

Nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
(NAD+), has robust cognitive benefits and alleviates neuroinflammation in 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mouse models without decreasing beta-amyloid plaque 
pathology. Such effects may be mediated by the reactive species interactome 
(RSI), at the metabolome level. In this study, we employed in vitro and in vivo 
models of oxidative stress, aging and AD to profile the effects of NR on 
neuronal survival, RSI, and the whole proteome characterization of cortex and 
hippocampus. RSI analysis yielded a complex modulation upon NR treatment. We 
constructed protein co-expression networks and correlated them to NR treatment 
and all measured reactive species. We observed brain-area specific effects of NR 
on co-expressed protein modules of oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid 
oxidation, and neurotransmitter regulation pathways, which correlated with RSI 
components. The current study contributes to the understanding of modulation of 
the metabolome, specifically after NR treatment in AD and how it may play 
disease-modifying roles.

Central neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD)) are tightly associated with extensive neuron loss. 
Current therapeutic interventions merely mitigate the symptoms of these 
diseases, falling short of addressing the fundamental issue of neuron loss. Cell 
reprogramming, involving the transition of a cell from one gene expression 
profile to another, has made significant strides in the conversion between 
diverse somatic cell types. This advancement has been facilitated by gene 
editing techniques or the synergistic application of small molecules, enabling 
the conversion of glial cells into functional neurons. Despite this progress, 
the potential for in situ reprogramming of astrocytes in treating 
neurodegenerative disorders faces challenges such as immune rejection and 
genotoxicity. A novel avenue emerges through chemical reprogramming of 
astrocytes utilizing small molecules, circumventing genotoxic effects and 
unlocking substantial clinical utility. Recent studies have successfully 
demonstrated the in situ conversion of astrocytes into neurons using small 
molecules. Nonetheless, these findings have sparked debates, encompassing 
queries regarding the origin of newborn neurons, pivotal molecular targets, and 
alterations in metabolic pathways. This review succinctly delineates the 
background of astrocytes reprogramming, meticulously surveys the principal 
classes of small molecule combinations employed thus far, and examines the 
complex signaling pathways they activate. Finally, this article delves into the 
potential vistas awaiting exploration in the realm of astrocytes chemical 
reprogramming, heralding a promising future for advancing our understanding and 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Targeting the gut microbiota may be an emerging strategy for the prevention and 
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Macro-molecular yeast β-glucan (BG), 
derived from the yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, regulates the gut 
microbiota. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of 
long-term BG in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced AD-like pathologies from the 
perspective of the gut microbiota. Here, we found that 80 weeks of BG treatment 
ameliorated HFD-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats. In the hippocampus, BG 
alleviated HFD-induced the activation of astrocytes, microglia, NOD-like 
receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome 
pathway, and AD-like pathologies. BG modulated gut dysbiosis through increasing 
the levels of beneficial bacteria and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). BG also 
attenuated HFD-induced gut barrier impairment. Correlation analysis revealed a 
close relationship among microbiota, SCFAs, and AD-like pathologies. 
Furthermore, the fecal microbiota of BG-treated rats and SCFAs treatment 
mitigated AD-like pathologies via the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in HFD-fed aged 
rats. These results suggested that long-term BG promotes the production of SCFAs 
derived from gut microbiota, which further inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated 
neuroinflammation, thereby alleviating HFD-induced AD-like pathologies in rats. 
BG may become a new strategy for targeting neurodegenerative diseases.

various factors including amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation. We investigated the 
pharmacological effects of the ethanol extract of Potentilla fragarioides var. 
major (Rosaceae) (EEPF) on AD-related pathogenesis, which remain elusive. We 
observed the effects of EEPF on Aβ disaggregation and free-radical scavenging 
activities for 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) 
and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) using in vitro assays, evaluated the 
effects of EEPF on memory loss in two animal models, and examined the molecular 
regulatory mechanisms of EEPF using an antibody-protein microarray in 
EEPF-treated neuronal cell lines. EEPF inhibited Aβ aggregation in a 
concentration-dependent manner and enhanced free-radical scavenging activities 
for ABTS and DPPH. EEPF significantly inhibited memory impairment in the passive 
avoidance task, Y-maze test, and Morris water maze test in scopolamine-induced 
short-term memory loss mice and Aβ-injected AD-like mice. Nissl staining and 
immunohistochemistry for NeuN and Iba-1 confirmed the neuroprotective and 
anti-inflammatory effects of EEPF in both animal models. In H2O2-treated HT22 
hippocampal cells, EEPF significantly prevented cell damage, enhanced CaMK2, and 
reduced ferric reductase. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglia, 
EEPF significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of inflammatory factors, 
such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor-α, and 
interleukin-6, and decreased the phosphorylation of Smad3 and cyclin D3. 
High-performance liquid chromatography confirmed that EEPF has five major 
components: neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, polydatin, isochlorogenic 
acid A, and buddleoside, with amounts ranging across 1.91-9.41 mg/g. EEPF may be 
a promising drug for treatment of AD and AD-related brain disorders.

PURPOSE: The discovery of the glymphatic system, crucial for cerebrospinal and 
interstitial fluid exchange, has enhanced our grasp of brain protein balance and 
its potential role in neurodegenerative disease prevention and therapy. 
Detecting early neurodegenerative shifts via noninvasive biomarkers could be key 
in identifying at-risk individuals for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our research 
explores a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method that measures cortical mean 
diffusivity (cMD), potentially a more sensitive indicator of neurodegeneration 
than traditional macrostructural methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 67 post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD)-diagnosed veterans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
database. Participants underwent structural MRI, DTI, Aβ PET imaging, and 
cognitive testing. We focused on the DTI-ALPS technique to assess glymphatic 
function and its relation to cMD, cortical Aβ accumulation, and thickness, 
accounting for age and APOE ε4 allele variations.
RESULTS: The cohort, all male with an average age of 68.1 (SD 3.4), showed a 
strong inverse correlation between DTI-ALPS and cMD in AD-affected regions, 
especially in the entorhinal, parahippocampal, and fusiform areas. Higher 
DTI-ALPS readings were consistently linked with greater cortical thickness, 
independent of Aβ deposits and genetic risk factors. Age and cMD emerged as 
inversely proportional predictors of DTI-ALPS, indicating a complex interaction 
with age.
CONCLUSION: The study confirms a meaningful association between glymphatic 
efficiency and cMD in AD-sensitive zones, accentuating cortical microstructural 
alterations in PTSD. It positions DTI-ALPS as a viable biomarker for assessing 
glymphatic function in PTSD, implicating changes in DTI-ALPS as indicative of 
glymphatic impairment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder. It is 
identified by the gradual shrinkage of the brain and the loss of brain cells. 
This leads to cognitive decline and impaired social functioning, making it a 
major contributor to dementia. While there are no treatments to reverse AD's 
progression, spotting the disease's onset can have a significant impact in the 
medical field. Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized medical image 
classification by automating feature engineering, removing the requirement for 
human experts in feature extraction. DL-based solutions are highly accurate but 
demand a lot of training data, which poses a common challenge. Transfer learning 
(TL) has gained attention for its knack for handling limited data and expediting 
model training. This study uses TL to classify AD using T1-weighted 3D Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) 
database. Four modified pre-trained deep neural networks (DNN), VGG16, 
MobileNet, DenseNet121, and NASNetMobile, are trained and evaluated on the ADNI 
dataset. The 3-1-3 weight averaging technique and fine-tuning improve the 
performance of the classification models. The evaluated accuracies for AD 
classification are VGG16: 98.75%; MobileNet: 97.5%; DenseNet: 97.5%; and 
NASNetMobile: 96.25%. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC), 
precision-recall (PR), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic plots validate the 
effectiveness of the modified pre-trained model. Modified VGG16 excels with area 
under the curve (AUC) values of 0.99 for ROC and 0.998 for PR curves. The 
proposed approach shows effective AD classification by achieving high accuracy 
using the 3-1-3 weight averaging technique and fine-tuning.

Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO; removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes) 
prior to age 48 is associated with elevated risk for both Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea. In early midlife, 
individuals with BSO show reduced hippocampal volume, function, and 
hippocampal-dependent verbal episodic memory performance associated with changes 
in sleep. It is unknown whether BSO affects fine-grained sleep measurements 
(sleep microarchitecture) and how these changes might relate to 
hippocampal-dependent memory. We recruited thirty-six early midlife participants 
with BSO. Seventeen of these participants were taking 17β-estradiol therapy 
(BSO+ET) and 19 had never taken ET (BSO). Twenty age-matched control 
participants with intact ovaries (AMC) were also included. Overnight at-home 
polysomnography recordings were collected, along with subjective sleep quality 
and hot flash frequency. Multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was 
used to assess how sleep varied between groups. Compared to AMC, BSO without ET 
was associated with significantly decreased time spent in non-rapid eye movement 
(NREM) stage 2 sleep as well as increased NREM stage 2 and 3 beta power, NREM 
stage 2 delta power, and spindle power and maximum amplitude. Increased spindle 
maximum amplitude was negatively correlated with verbal episodic memory 
performance. Decreased sleep latency, increased sleep efficiency, and increased 
time spent in rapid eye movement sleep were observed for BSO+ET. Findings 
suggest there is an association between ovarian hormone loss and sleep 
microarchitecture, which may contribute to poorer cognitive outcomes and be 
ameliorated by ET.

One of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases is Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). The hallmarks of AD include the accumulation of amyloid plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles, which cause related secondary diseases, progressive 
neurodegeneration, and ultimately death. The most prevalent cell type in the 
human central nervous system, astrocytes, are crucial for controlling neuronal 
function. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is released from tissue into 
the bloodstream due to astrocyte breakdown in neurological diseases. Increased 
levels of GFAP in the serum can function as blood markers and be an effective 
prognostic indicator to help diagnose neurological conditions early on, from 
stroke to neurodegenerative diseases. The human central nervous system (CNS) is 
greatly affected by diseases associated with blood GFAP levels. These include 
multiple sclerosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, glioblastoma multiforme, traumatic 
brain injuries, and neuromyelitis optica. GFAP demonstrates a strong diagnostic 
capacity for projecting outcomes following an injury. Furthermore, the increased 
ability to identify GFAP protein fragments helps facilitate treatment, as it 
allows continuous screening of CNS injuries and early identification of 
potential recurrences. GFAP has recently gained attention due to data showing 
that the plasma biomarker is effective in identifying AD pathology. AD accounts 
for 60-70% of the approximately 50 million people with dementia worldwide. It is 
critical to develop molecular markers for AD, whose number is expected to 
increase to about 3 times and affect humans by 2050, and to investigate possible 
targets to confirm their effectiveness in the early diagnosis of AD. In 
addition, most diagnostic methods currently used are image-based and do not 
detect early disease, i.e. before symptoms appear; thus, treatment options and 
outcomes are limited. Therefore, recently developed methods such as 
point-of-care (POC), on-site applications, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay-polymerase chain reaction (ELISA-PCR) that provide both faster and more 
accurate results are gaining importance. This systematic review summarizes 
published studies with different approaches such as immunosensor, lateral flow, 
POC, ELISA-PCR, and molecularly imprinted polymer using GFAP, a potential blood 
biomarker to detect neurological disorders. Here, we also provide an overview of 
current approaches, analysis methods, and different future detection strategies 
for GFAP, the most popular biosensing field.

The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a specific protein complex located 
in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Comprising a heterodimer of two homodimeric 
membrane proteins, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 and mitochondrial pyruvate 
carrier 2, MPC connects cytoplasmic metabolism to mitochondrial metabolism by 
transferring pyruvate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. The nervous system 
requires substantial energy to maintain its function, and the mitochondrial 
energy supply is closely linked to neurological function. Mitochondrial 
dysfunction can induce or exacerbate intracerebral pathologies. MPC influences 
mitochondrial function due to its specific role as a pyruvate transporter. 
However, recent studies on MPC and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurological 
disorders have yielded controversial results, and the underlying mechanisms 
remain unclear. In this brief review, we provide an overview of the structure 
and function of MPC. We further discuss the potential mechanisms and feasibility 
of targeting MPC in treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and 
cerebral ischemia/hypoxia injury. This review aims to offer insights into MPC as 
a target for clinical treatment.

BACKGROUND: While drainage/removal of fluid and toxins from the brain by 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) directly into venous blood is well-known, a second 
drainage route has recently been (re)discovered-meningeal lymphatic vessels 
(mLVs)-which are responsible for up to half of total brain fluid/toxin drainage. 
The cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increases mLV diameter 
and numbers to increase mLV drainage, resulting in increased mLV drainage. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by low plasma and CSF levels of VEGF.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if non-invasive transcranial radiofrequency wave 
treatment (TRFT), through modulation of VEGF levels in blood and CSF, can affect 
removal of toxins tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) from the brain.
METHODS: Eight mild/moderate AD subjects were given twice-daily 1-hour TRFT 
sessions at home by their caregivers. Blood and CSF samples were taken at 
baseline and following completion of 2 months of TRFT.
RESULTS: In plasma and/or CSF, strong baseline correlations between VEGF levels 
and AD markers (t-tau, p-tau, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42) were eliminated by TRFT. This 
effect was primarily due to TRFT-induced increases in VEGF levels in AD subjects 
with low or unmeasurable "baseline" VEGF levels. These increased VEGF levels 
were associated with increased clearance/drainage of tau and Aβ from the brain, 
likely through VEGF's actions on mLVs.
CONCLUSIONS: A new mechanism of TRFT is identified (facilitation of brain tau 
and Aβ clearance via VEGF) that is likely contributory to TRFT's reversal of 
cognitive impairment in AD subjects. TRFT may be particularly effective for 
cognitive benefit in AD subjects who have low VEGF levels.

Knowledge of performance in activities of daily living and quality of life is 
important for management decisions and research endpoints. The use of harmonized 
scales is essential for objective assessment of both caregivers and patients 
with dementia with Lewy bodies. Functionality and quality of life are more 
impaired in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Alzheimer's disease, mostly due to 
higher prevalence of behavioral symptoms and motor manifestations in dementia 
with Lewy bodies. More longitudinal studies are required to assess if causality 
mediates the associations of clinical features with functional independence and 
worsened quality of life in these patients.

BACKGROUND: There are currently no uniform treatments for post-stroke comorbid 
cognitive impairment and depression (PSCCID).
OBJECTIVE: To verify whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
can improve PSCCID symptoms and explore the underlying roles of resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).
METHODS: Thirty PSCCID patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive 4 
weeks of rTMS (intervention group) or sham rTMS (control group) over the left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). rs-fMRI was acquired to analyze the 
functional plasticity of brain regions at baseline and immediately after the 
last intervention.
RESULTS: Cognition, depression status, and neural electrophysiology were 
improved in both intervention and control groups after treatment 
(p = 0.015-0.042), and the intervention group had more significant improvement 
than the control group. Analysis of functional connectivities (FCs) within the 
default mood network (DMN) showed that the connection strength of the left 
temporal pole/left parahippocampal cortex and right lateral temporal 
cortex/right retrosplenial cortex in the intervention group were enhanced 
compared with its pre-intervention and that in the control group after treatment 
(p < 0.05), and the both FC values were positively correlated with MMSE scores 
(p < 0.001). The intervention group had stronger FCs within the DMN compared 
with the control group after treatment, and some of the enhanced FCs were 
correlated with the P300 latency and amplitude.
CONCLUSIONS: rTMS over the left DLPFC is an effective treatment for improving 
both cognitive impairment and depression among patients with PSCCID. The 
enhanced FCs within the DMN may serve as a compensatory functional recombination 
to promote clinical recovery.

Dose Response of Transcranial Photobiomodulation on Cognitive Efficiency in 
Healthy Older Adults: A Task-Related Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy 
Study.

Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease has become increasingly prevalent among the 
older population, leading to significant social and economic burdens. 
Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) has shown promise as a cognitive 
intervention for enhancing cognitive efficiency in healthy older adults, and 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, 
determining the optimal tPBM dosage is crucial for ensuring effective and 
efficient intervention.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effects of different dosages in a 
single tPBM session on cognitive efficiency in healthy older adults.
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 88 healthy older participants were 
assigned to either a single dose (irradiance = 30 mW/cm2, fluence = 10.8 J/cm2; 
n = 44) or a double dose (irradiance = 30 mW/cm2, fluence = 21.6 J/cm2; n = 44) 
tPBM session. Cognitive efficiency was assessed using functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy during a visual working memory span task.
RESULTS: The single dose group exhibited significantly greater cognitive 
efficiency enhancement, indicated by a more pronounced reduction in oxygenated 
hemoglobin during a challenging task level (span level 9) (p = 0.021, d = 0.50), 
and better working memory task performance (p = 0.045, d = 0.31). Furthermore, 
participants with better visuospatial abilities demonstrated greater improvement 
after a single dose (r = -0.42, p = 0.004). In contrast, participants with 
varying cognitive function did not exhibit additional benefits from a double 
dose (r = -0.22-0.15, p = 0.16-0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher tPBM dosages may not necessarily 
result in superior cognitive improvement in older adults.

BACKGROUND: Gantenerumab is an anti-amyloid-β immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal 
antibody for subcutaneous (SC) administration. The efficacy and safety of 
low-dose (105 mg or 225 mg) gantenerumab were investigated in Marguerite RoAD 
(MR; NCT02051608), a Phase III, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled study in 
participants with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Following a preplanned 
futility analysis of the SCarlet RoAD study (NCT01224106), MR was converted into 
an open-label extension (OLE).
OBJECTIVE: The DB study aimed to assess the efficacy of gantenerumab compared 
with placebo from baseline to Week 104 in participants with mild AD dementia. 
Following conversion to an OLE, this objective became exploratory, as the OLE 
assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of SC gantenerumab at doses of up 
to 1,200 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in OLE participants.
METHODS: Eligible DB study participants were offered the opportunity to receive 
gantenerumab up-titrated to 1,200 mg Q4W. Safety and tolerability were assessed 
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physical and neurologic examinations, 
and adverse event monitoring.
RESULTS: Overall, 225 participants were rolled over from the DB part of MR and 
received ≥1 gantenerumab dose in the OLE. The median treatment duration was 123 
weeks. Fifty-nine (26.2%) and 41 (18.2%) participants had amyloid-related 
imaging abnormality (ARIA)-edema and ARIA-hemorrhage MRI findings, respectively. 
ARIA findings were manageable with MRI monitoring and dose intervention; most 
were asymptomatic. There were no unexpected safety findings.

INTRODUCTION: The misfolding and aggregation of proteins are associated with 
various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
small-molecule engineered antibodies, such as single-chain fragment variable 
(scFv) antibodies and nanobodies (Nbs), have gained attention in recent years 
due to their strong conformational specificity, ability to cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), low immunogenicity, and enhanced proximity to active sites within 
aggregates.
AREAS COVERED: We have reviewed recent advances in therapies involving scFvs and 
Nbs that efficiently and specifically target pathological protein aggregates. 
Relevant publications were searched for in MEDLINE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, Elsevier 
ScienceDirect and Wiley Online Library.
EXPERT OPINION: We reviewed the recent and specific targeting of pathological 
protein aggregates by scFvs and Nbs. These engineered antibodies can inhibit the 
aggregation or promote the disassembly of misfolded proteins by recognizing 
antigenic epitopes or through conformational specificity. Additionally, we 
discuss strategies for improving the effective application of engineered 
antibodies in treating AD. These technological strategies will lay the 
foundation for the clinical application of small-molecule antibody drugs in 
developing effective treatments for neurological diseases. Through rational 
application strategies, small-molecule engineered antibodies are expected to 
have significant potential in targeted therapy for neurological disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) has a long preclinical phase in which AD 
pathology is accumulating without detectable clinical symptoms. It is critical 
to identify participants in this preclinical phase as early as possible since 
treatment plans may be more effective in this stage. Monitoring for changes in 
driving behavior, as measured with GPS sensors, has been explored as a 
low-burden, easy-to-administer method for detecting AD risk. However, driving is 
a complex, multifaceted process that is likely influenced by other factors, 
including personality traits, that may change in preclinical AD.
METHODS: We examine the moderating influence of neuroticism and 
conscientiousness on longitudinal changes in driving behavior in a sample of 203 
clinically normal older adults who are at varying risk of developing AD.
RESULTS: Neuroticism moderated rates of change in the frequency of speeding as 
well as the number of trips taken at night. Conscientiousness moderated rates of 
change in typical driving space.
CONCLUSIONS: Personality traits change in early AD and also influence driving 
behaviors. Studies that seek to utilize naturalistic driving behavior to 
establish AD risk need to accommodate interpersonal differences, of which 
personality traits are one of many possible factors. Future studies should 
explicitly establish how much benefit is provided by including personality 
traits in predictive models of AD progression.

Prostaglandins in the Inflamed Central Nervous System: Potential Therapeutic 
Targets.

The global burden of neurological disorders is evident, yet there remains 
limited efficacious therapeutics for their treatment. There is a growing 
recognition of the role of inflammation in diseases of the central nervous 
system (CNS); among the numerous inflammatory mediators involved, prostaglandins 
play a crucial role. Prostaglandins are small lipid mediators derived from 
arachidonic acid via multi-enzymatic pathways. The actions of prostaglandins are 
varied, with each prostaglandin having a specific role in maintaining 
homeostasis. In the CNS, prostaglandins can have neuroprotective or neurotoxic 
properties depending on their specific G-protein receptor. These G-protein 
receptors have varying subfamilies, tissue distribution, and signal transduction 
cascades. Further studies into the impact of prostaglandins in CNS-based 
diseases may contribute to the clarification of their actions, hopefully leading 
to the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies. This review focuses on 
the roles played by prostaglandins in neural degeneration, with a focus on 
Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 
both preclinical and clinical settings. We further discuss current 
prostaglandin-related agonists and antagonists concerning suggestions for their 
use as future therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess the impact of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) 
and memantine on cognition, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and 
mortality in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
METHODS: A total of 1,095 incident DLB patients from the Swedish Registry on 
cognitive/dementia disorders were included. Using an inverse probability of 
treatment weighting, the effect of initiating ChEI or memantine within 90 days 
of DLB diagnosis and nonuse was evaluated on cognitive trajectories and risks of 
MACE and death.
RESULTS: The use of ChEIs significantly slowed cognitive decline at follow-ups 
(Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] -0.39 points/y; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], -0.96 to 0.18) compared to memantine (-2.49 points/y; -4.02 to -0.97) and 
nonuse (-2.50 points/y; -4.28 to -0.73). Treatment groups did not differ in MACE 
events. ChEI use was associated with lower risk of death in the first year after 
DLB diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.46, 0.94).
DISCUSSION: Our findings illuminate the potential benefits of ChEI treatment in 
DLB patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cholinesterase inhibitors slow cognitive decline over a 5-year 
follow-up period when compared to both memantine treatment and nonuse in 
patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Cholinesterase Inhibitors reduce risk 
of mortality within the initial year, but this effect is not sustained after 1 
year in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.

This paper presents data analysis of a large dataset of outpatient records for 
the purpose of establishing accurate prevalence rates of dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease in Bulgaria. The research is motivated by the lack of 
accurate prevalence data as well as statistics about the actual number of people 
affected by dementia at national level. Health data from pseudonymized 
outpatient records (1,378,355) of 642,013 unique patients (Male 39.88%, Female 
61.67%) with visits to neurologists and psychiatrists in 2018 was mapped to an 
OMOP CDM relational database. The size of this dataset is one of largest in the 
EU context. Prevalence of dementia for all age groups [30,100+] years is 1.61% 
(Male 0.62%, Female 0.99%) and Alzheimer' disease prevalence is 0.39% (Male 
0.15%, Female 0.24%), where 24.34% of all the patients with dementia suffer 
Alzheimer's disease. The mean prevalence rates of dementia and Alzheimer's 
disease for ages above 64 are 9.52% (CI 95%, [6.98%, 12.04%]) and 1.04 % (CI 
95%, [0.84%, 1.27%,]). A comparison with EU statistics yields 0.07% difference 
for dementia prevalence, while data visualization confirms the known patterns of 
prevalence with aging and gender specifics These results stimulate further 
research and support the development of a national strategy for dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease.

Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, has also been 
linked to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review 
synthesizes the current evidence on how managing hypertension may influence 
cognitive health, particularly among elderly populations and those with 
cognitive impairments. By analyzing data from randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs), clinical trials, and cross-sectional studies, we evaluated the efficacy 
of various interventions, including pharmacological treatments, lifestyle 
modifications, and multidomain approaches that address blood pressure (BP) 
variability and intensive versus standard blood pressure control. Our findings 
reveal that effective blood pressure management can mitigate cognitive decline 
and potentially alter the course of Alzheimer's disease. However, the results 
also highlight complexities, such as the risk of adverse effects from intensive 
blood pressure control on cognitive processing and hippocampal volume. This 
review underscores the need for tailored hypertension management strategies that 
balance cardiovascular health with cognitive outcomes, suggesting that 
stabilizing blood pressure variability could play a crucial role. Future 
research should focus on longitudinal studies to refine these management 
strategies and enhance treatment guidelines, improving overall outcomes for 
patients at risk of cognitive decline.

INTRODUCTION: Anticipating the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at an early 
asymptomatic at-risk stage, where therapeutics can more effectively delay 
conscious cognitive decline, is currently among the biggest challenges in the 
field. Herein, we aimed to compare the capacity of the Memory Binding Test (MBT) 
with the official diagnostic tool, the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test 
(FCSRT), to anticipate AD diagnosis at an early preclinical stage based on the 
associative memory component of MBT (binding), suggested as more sensitive to 
the emergence of subtle episodic memory (EM) deficits (AD hallmark).
METHODS: We assessed the tests performance longitudinally (over 5 years) in 263 
cognitively-normal elderly individuals at risk of AD (>6 months of subjective 
memory complaints) using linear mixed-effect models controlled for age, sex, and 
education. We stratified participants in 2 models: amyloid-β 
(Aβ)/neurodegeneration (N) model, assessing Aβ burden and neurodegeneration 
effect [3 groups: controls (Aβ-/N-); stable/N- (Aβ+); stable/N+ (Aβ+)]; and the 
stable/progressors model, assessing progression to prodromal-AD effect [2 
groups: stable (Aβ+); progressors (Aβ+)], based on 15 subjects who progressed to 
AD during follow-up (excluded once diagnosed).
RESULTS: Aβ burden was associated with significantly less MBT-intrusions, while 
Aβ burden and neurodegeneration together, with the most. Progression status had 
a strong negative effect on both tests performance. When compared with the 
FCSRT, the MBT seems to anticipate diagnosis based on a worst performance in a 
higher number of scores (including binding) in at least a year.
DISCUSSION: Anticipation of diagnosis to an asymptomatic at-risk stage, while 
participants remain cognitively-normal according to FCSRT cut-offs and unaware 
of objective EM deficits, has the potential to delay the onset of AD-linked 
cognitive decline by applying promising therapeutics before decline becomes too 
advanced.
