Polymorphisms in CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) predispose to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that 
loss of CD2AP in cerebral blood vessels is associated with cognitive decline in 
AD subjects and that genetic downregulation of CD2AP in brain vascular 
endothelial cells impairs memory function in male mice. Animals with reduced 
brain endothelial CD2AP display altered blood flow regulation at rest and during 
neurovascular coupling, defects in mural cell activity, and an abnormal vascular 
sex-dependent response to Aβ. Antagonizing endothelin-1 receptor A signaling 
partly rescues the vascular impairments, but only in male mice. Treatment of 
CD2AP mutant mice with reelin glycoprotein that mitigates the effects of CD2AP 
loss function via ApoER2 increases resting cerebral blood flow and even protects 
male mice against the noxious effect of Aβ. Thus, endothelial CD2AP plays 
critical roles in cerebrovascular functions and represents a novel target for 
sex-specific treatment in AD.

Tauopathy is widely observed in multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and characterized by abnormal tau protein 
phosphorylation, aggregation and its accumulation as a form of neurofibrillary 
tangle (NFT) in the brain. However, there are no effective treatments targeting 
tau pathology in the AD. Vitamin C is known to reduce tauopathy and modulate one 
of its regulators called glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in the body. 
Nevertheless, vitamin C has a limitation of its stability during metabolism due 
to its chemical properties. Thus, in the current study, NXP032 (a vitamin 
C/aptamer complex) was tested as a candidate for tau-targeting treatment because 
it can preserve antioxidative efficacy of vitamin C before it can reach the 
target tissue. In this context, the current study aimed to investigate the 
therapeutic effect of NXP032 on tauopathy in vivo and in vitro. As a result, 
NXP032 attenuated cognitive and memory decline and reduced NFT and tau 
hyperphosphorylation in the P301S mutant human tau transgenic mice (or called 
PS19 mice). In addition, NXP032 suppressed neuroinflammation found in the PS19 
mice. Furthermore, NXP032 protected SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells from 
okadaic acid (OKA)-induced cytotoxicity. Especially, 10 ng/ml of NXP032 reduced 
tau hyperphosphorylation and GSK3 activation though its phosphorylation at 
Tyr216 site which were promoted by OKA treatment in the SH-SY5Y cells. Taken 
together, our results suggest that NXP032 might be a potential therapy for AD 
and tauopathy-related neurodegenerative disorders as well.

Parkinson`s disease stands as the second-most widespread neurodegenerative 
disorder. Parkinson`s disease is relentless in progression and irreversible in 
nature, for which there is no cure. Therapies are only used to attenuate motor 
symptoms. As Parkinson`s disease is primarily defined by degeneration of 
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and considering that 
neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in these neurons are key factors 
contributing to disease progression, alternative therapies should aim to 
preserve healthy mitochondria. Method. Eligible studies on the effect of 
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on Parkinson`s disease were collected from PubMed, 
Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane library for clinical, 
in-vivo, and in-vitro studies. Result. UDCA and its taurine conjugate (TUDCA), 
which are endogenous bile acids, have exhibited neuroprotective potential in 
various neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease and Huntington's disease, in both animal experimental models and 
clinical investigations. This is attributed to three significant properties, in 
addition to their capability to cross the blood-brain barrier. First, their 
anti-inflammatory properties are manifested through the reduction of significant 
inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β and other 
related elements. Second, their antioxidant property is marked by an increase in 
the expression of superoxide dismuthase, glutathione peroxidase and other 
antioxidant enzymes. The third property is the antiapoptotic activity, 
characterized by decreased caspase-3 activity and lower expression of 
pro-apoptotic Bax in the striatum. Conclusion. Based on this comprehensive 
review, UDCA and TUDCA have the potential to be considered as a therapeutic 
agent in the management of the Parkinson's disease.

The central nervous system (CNS) is immune-privileged by several 
immuno-modulators as interleukins (ILs). ILs are cytokines secreted by immune 
cells for cell-cell signaling communications and affect the functions of the 
CNS. ILs were reported to orchestrate different molecular and cellular 
mechanisms of both physiological and pathological events, through overproduction 
or over-expression of their receptors. They interact with numerous receptors 
mediating pro-inflammatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. Interleukins have 
been implicated to participate in neurodegenerative diseases. They play a 
critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology which is characterized by 
the over-production of pro-inflammatory ILs. These may aggravate 
neurodegeneration, in addition to their contribution to detrimental mechanisms 
as oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity. However, recent research on the 
relation between ILs and AD revealed major discrepancies. Most of the major ILs 
were shown to play both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles in different 
experimental settings and models. The interactions between different ILs through 
shared pathways also add to the difficulty of drawing solid conclusions. In 
addition, targeting the different ILs has not yielded consistent results. The 
repeated failures of therapeutic drugs in treating AD necessitate the search for 
novel agents targeting multiple mechanisms of the disease pathology. In this 
context, the understanding of interleukins and their roles throughout the 
disease progression and interaction with other systems in the brain may provide 
promising therapeutic targets for the prevention or treatment of AD.

Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the assembly of specific proteins 
into oligomers and fibrillar aggregates. At the brain scale, these protein 
assemblies can diffuse through the brain and seed other regions, creating an 
autocatalytic protein progression. The growth and transport of these assemblies 
depend on various mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we use 
spatially-extended nucleation-aggregation-fragmentation models for the dynamics 
of prion-like neurodegenerative protein-spreading in the brain to study the 
effect of different drugs on whole-brain Alzheimer's disease progression.

Rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin (STZ-icv) develop 
pathologic features, which resemble those in Alzheimer's disease and have been 
proposed as a non-transgenic model for sporadic type of the disease (sAD). We 
aimed to characterize cholinergic transmission in the rat brain as a function of 
STZ-icv dose and time after the treatment. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity 
and expression of muscarinic (M1, M4) and nicotinic (α7) receptors, cholin 
acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were 
measured in hippocampus (HPC) and parietotemporal cortex (CTX) of STZ-icv and 
age-matched control rats one week, and one, three, six and nine months after the 
icv administration of STZ (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg), respectively. Cholinergic and 
astroglial changes were found most pronounced with a highest STZ dose in 
time-dependent manner. The cortex and hippocampus exhibited specific alterations 
in cholinergic transmission following STZ-icv administration, with either 
similar or distinct patterns depending on the parameter observed: increased AChE 
activity in HPC and invariable in CTX; increased M4 and ChAT levels in both 
regions; substantial cortical M1 level increment and moderate hippocampal M1 
decrement; and decreased α7 levels in both regions, with subsequent increase 
observed only in HPC. Alterations in cerebral cholinergic neurotransmission in 
STZ-icv rat model were mostly following a threephasic time pattern: acute 
response (Phase I), complete/partial compensation (Phase II), and 
reappearance/progression of changes (Phase III). Staging structure of 
cholinergic changes in STZ-icv rat model might be speculated to partly correlate 
with cholinergic pathology in clinical AD stages.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Exposure to chronic stress and high levels of 
glucocorticoid hormones in adulthood has been associated with cognitive deficits 
and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dazucorilant has recently 
emerged as a selective glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) modulator, exhibiting 
efficacy in counteracting amyloid-β toxicity in an acute model of AD. We aim to 
assess the therapeutic potential of dazucorilant in reversing amyloid and tau 
pathologies through the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor pathological 
activity, and providing additional evidence for its consideration in AD 
treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The efficacy of dazucorilant was evaluated in two 
transgenic mouse models of amyloid pathology. The slowly progressing J20 and the 
aggressively pathological 5xFAD mice. Behavioural analysis was conducted to 
evaluate welfare, cognitive performances and anxiety levels. The activity of the 
glucocorticoid receptor system, neuroinflammation, amyloid burden and tau 
phosphorylation were examined in hippocampi.
KEY RESULTS: In both AD models, chronic treatment with dazucorilant improved 
working and long-term spatial memories along with the inhibition of 
glucocorticoid receptor-dependent pathogenic processes and the normalization of 
plasma glucocorticoid levels. Dazucorilant treatment also resulted in a 
reduction in tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid production and aggregation. 
Additionally, dazucorilant seemed to mediate a specific re-localization of 
activated glial cells onto amyloid plaques in J20 mice, suggesting a restoration 
of physiological neuroinflammatory processes.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Dazucorilant exhibited sustained disease-modifying 
effects in two AD models. Given that this compound has demonstrated safety and 
tolerability in human subjects, our results provide pre-clinical support for 
conducting clinical trials to evaluate its potential in AD.

BACKGROUND: The traditional process of developing new drugs is time-consuming 
and often unsuccessful, making drug repurposing an appealing alternative due to 
its speed and safety. Graph neural networks (GCNs) have emerged as a leading 
approach for predicting drug-disease associations by integrating drug and 
disease-related networks with advanced deep learning algorithms. However, GCNs 
generally infer association probabilities only for existing drugs and diseases, 
requiring network re-establishment and retraining for novel entities. 
Additionally, these methods often struggle with sparse networks and fail to 
elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying newly predicted drugs.
METHODS: To address the limitations of traditional methods, we developed 
HEDDI-Net, a heterogeneous embedding architecture designed to accurately detect 
drug-disease associations while preserving the interpretability of biological 
mechanisms. HEDDI-Net integrates graph and shallow learning techniques to 
extract representative diseases and proteins, respectively. These representative 
diseases and proteins are used to embed the input features, which are then 
utilized in a multilayer perceptron for predicting drug-disease associations.
RESULTS: In experiments, HEDDI-Net achieves areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve of over 0.98, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. 
Rigorous recovery analyses reveal a median recovery rate of 73% for the top 100 
diseases, demonstrating its efficacy in identifying novel target diseases for 
existing drugs, known as drug repurposing. A case study on Alzheimer's disease 
highlighted the model's practical applicability and interpretability, 
identifying potential drug candidates like Baclofen, Fluoxetine, Pentoxifylline 
and Phenytoin. Notably, over 40% of the predicted candidates in the clusters of 
commonly prescribed clinical drugs Donepezil and Galantamine had been tested in 
clinical trials, validating the model's predictive accuracy and practical 
relevance.
CONCLUSIONS: HEDDI-NET represents a significant advancement by allowing direct 
application to new diseases and drugs without the need for retraining, a 
limitation of most GCN-based methods. Furthermore, HEDDI-Net provides detailed 
affinity patterns with representative proteins for predicted candidate drugs, 
facilitating an understanding of their physiological effects. This capability 
also supports the design and testing of alternative drugs that are similar to 
existing medications, enhancing the reliability and interpretability of 
potential repurposed drugs. The case study on Alzheimer's disease further 
underscores HEDDI-Net's ability to predict promising drugs and its applicability 
in drug repurposing.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that currently 
lacks effective treatment options. This study aimed to identify potential 
therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD using comprehensive bioinformatics 
methods and machine learning algorithms. By integrating differential gene 
expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, Mfuzz 
clustering, single-cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning algorithms 
including LASSO regression, SVM-RFE, and random forest, five hub genes related 
to AD, including PLCB1, NDUFAB1, KRAS, ATP2A2, and CALM3 were identified. PLCB1, 
in particular, exhibited the highest diagnostic value in AD and showed 
significant correlation with Braak stages and neuronal expression. Furthermore, 
Noscapine, PX-316, and TAK-901 were selected as potential therapeutic drugs for 
AD based on PLCB1. This research provides a comprehensive and reliable method 
for the discovery of AD therapeutic targets and the construction of diagnostic 
models, offering important insights and directions for future AD treatment 
strategies and drug development.

Although distinct diseases, both cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by the aggregation and accumulation 
of amyloid-β (Aβ). This is thought to be due, in part, to impaired perivascular 
Aβ clearance from the brain. This shared failure in both diseases presents a 
common opportunity for therapeutic intervention. In this review we discuss the 
idea that promoting perivascular brain clearance could be an effective strategy 
for safely reducing Aβ levels in CAA and AD thereby improving clinical outcomes, 
most notably hemorrhagic stroke and cognitive decline. We will explore the 
evidence for the different forces that are thought to drive perivascular brain 
clearance, review the literature on potential strategies for potentiating these 
driving forces, and finally we will discuss the substantial translational 
challenges and considerations that would accompany such an intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical performance of the cognition battery on Step 
1 (CogStep1) as a screening tool to detect (1) individuals with objective 
cognitive impairment regardless of their Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score, 
and specifically (2) to identify patients who could potentially benefit from 
anti-amyloid treatments. It was hypothesized that CogStep1 was sensitive enough 
to identify individuals with mild stages of cognitive deterioration compared 
with a comprehensive neuropsychological and clinical evaluation.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 60 and older referred to the Toulouse 
Memory Clinic.
METHODS: Participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and clinical 
evaluation and were also screened with the integrated care in older people 
(ICOPE)-monitor Step 1 by trained health professionals a maximum of 6 months 
before their memory consultation. Objective cognitive impairment was defined as 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, according to National Institute on 
Aging and the Alzheimer's Association criteria. A positive CogStep1 screening 
was considered if people had at least 1 mistake in the 3-word recall or the time 
orientation (weekday, month, year). Sensitivity, specificity, area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), positive predictive value 
(PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated.
RESULTS: Among the 352 participants [54.8% women, mean age 76.5 (SD 6.7)], 78.1% 
had a positive screening for CogStep1, and 75.6% had objective cognitive 
impairment. The clinimetric properties of CogStep1 to detect objective cognitive 
impairment (vs those without) were sensitivity = 87.0 (95% CI, 82.3-90.8), 
specificity = 48.8 (95% CI, 37.9-59.9), AUROC = 0.68 (95% CI, 0.62-0.74), PPV = 
83.8 (95% CI, 78.8-87.9), and NPV = 55.3 (95% CI, 43.4-66.7). We found similar 
values among individuals with MCI or mild dementia who could be potential users 
of new anti-amyloid drugs (MMSE score ≥ 20 or 22).
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: CogStep1 demonstrated good sensitivity and PPV to 
identify objective cognitive impairment among older people referred to a memory 
clinic. Achieving excellent sensitivity and specificity values is challenging 
for a very short test. However, CogStep1 proved useful for risk-stratifying 
patients who can benefit from further cognitive assessment, biomarker 
measurements, and therapeutic management, especially in the context of new 
anti-amyloid therapies.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the immediate and long-term effects of a visitor 
restriction policy on antipsychotic use in nursing home (NH) residents with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) during COVID-19.
DESIGN: A repeated cross-sectional study time series analysis was conducted 
using NH electronic health records (EHRs) from January 1, 2020, to December 
31, 2021.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A large, multistate sample of NH residents living with 
ADRD.
METHODS: We calculated weekly changes in facility-level prevalence of 
antipsychotic use using interrupted time series (ITS) to compare level and slope 
changes in antipsychotic use before, during, and after NH visitation 
restrictions. Generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations, 
logit link, binomial distribution, and AR-1 correlation structure were used for 
all ITS analyses. Final models were stratified by long- and short-stay residents 
and adjusted for NH-level covariates including resident demographics, clinical 
diagnoses, and nurse staffing.
RESULTS: We observed more than 8500 long-stay and 2700 short-stay NH residents 
with ADRD. Among long-stay residents, the weekly prevalence of antipsychotic use 
increased from 18.9% as of January 7, 2020, to 24.9% by December 31, 2021. For 
short-stay residents, antipsychotic use increased from 21.1% to 26.6% over this 
same window. The ITS analysis showed no meaningful changes in the relative rate 
of change in antipsychotic use during and after visitor restrictions, relative 
to pre-policy trends.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
visitation restriction policy had no meaningful impact on antipsychotic use 
among NH residents with ADRD. However, antipsychotic use increased over time for 
both long- and short-stay residents and remained above pre-pandemic levels by 
the end of 2021. Our findings emphasize the potential for increased reliance on 
pharmacotherapy to manage resident symptoms during public health emergencies. 
Future infection control efforts should prioritize safe interpersonal care 
delivery and consider policies that improve vigilance of medication utilization 
changes among high-risk populations.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and summarize alterations found in 
resting-state activity as measured via functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
(fNIRS) in neurodegenerative diseases.
BACKGROUND: fNIRS is a novel and emerging neuroimaging method suitable for a 
variety of study designs. Resting-state is the measure of brain activity in the 
absence of a task, which has been investigated for yielding information about 
neurodegenerative diseases, mainly using magnetic resonance imaging. We aimed to 
systematically review the usage of resting-state fNIRS (rsfNIRS) in 
neurodegenerative diseases.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies investigating people diagnosed with a 
neurodegenerative disease and resting-state activity obtained with fNIRS using 
at least two channels.
METHODS: We searched three databases for publications. After the screening, 16 
studies were included in the systematic review. The quality of the studies was 
assessed, and data were extracted. Data were qualitatively synthesized and in 
the case of at least 10 similar studies, a meta-analysis was planned.
RESULTS: Most studies investigated Mild cognitive impairment (50%), followed by 
Alzheimer's disease (25%). Other neurodegenerative diseases encompassed 
Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. All 
studies reported oxygenated hemoglobin. Still, studies were heterogeneous in 
terms of study design, measurement duration, fNIRS device, montage, 
pre-processing, and analyses. A meta-analysis was not considered possible due to 
this heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: rsfNIRS shows promise in neurodegenerative disease, as most studies 
have observed resting-state alterations when compared to healthy controls. 
However, inconsistencies across studies limit data comparison and meta-analysis. 
Hence, we strongly advocate the application of fNIRS reporting guidelines and 
the establishment of rsfNIRS-specific guidelines. This will ensure reliable and 
comparable results in future research.

BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) can 
complicate acute hospital care, but evidence on BPSD in this setting is 
heterogeneous.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of BPSD in acute hospitals and explore 
related risk factors, treatments, and outcomes (PROSPERO: CRD42023406294).
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching 
Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO for studies on BPSD prevalence among 
older people with dementia during their acute hospital admissions (up to 5 March 
2024). Independent double-review processes were used for study screening, 
selection, and data extraction. Data on 12 BPSD symptoms were extracted based on 
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI) and Behavioural Pathology in 
Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-ad). Risk factors, treatments, and outcomes were 
summarised. Meta-analysis was used to synthesise results.
RESULTS: Out of 15 101 records, 30 articles from 23 studies were included. Most 
studies were rated as moderate (n = 12) to poor (n = 17) quality. Meta-analysis 
revealed a pooled prevalence of overall BPSD (one or more BPSD symptoms) at 60% 
(95% CI = 43-78%) among older inpatients with dementia in acute hospitals 
(N = 11 studies). Subgroup analysis showed variations in the overall BPSD 
prevalence based on assessment tools (BEHAVE-ad = 85%, NPI = 74%, Others = 40%). 
Common BPSD symptoms included aggression/agitation (39%), sleep problems (38%), 
eating problems (36%), and irritability (32%). BPSD were linked to delirium, 
pain, increased use of uncomfortable interventions, psychotropic medication uses 
and higher caregiver distress. Poor patient-staff interactions and fragmented 
discharge plans often led to frequent emergency admissions and hospital 
readmissions.
CONCLUSION: Healthcare systems should implement tailored approaches for managing 
BPSD in acute hospitals, enhance staff training, improve caregiver 
communication, and develop integrated discharge plans.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is one of the most pressing health concerns among the 
ageing population, imposing significant health, financial and caregiving burdens 
on people with dementia (PWD), their families and caregivers. Building the 
capacity of nursing students is essential for effectively improving quality of 
life for affected people. This study aimed to assess nursing students' knowledge 
and attitudes toward dementia and its associated factors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in four medical schools educating 
3-year and 4-year diploma nursing students in northern, central and southern 
Vietnam, who were selected based on convenience. Six hundred full-time diploma 
senior nursing students were recruited for the survey. A self-administered 
questionnaire consisted of 34 true-false questions evaluating students' 
knowledge about dementia (Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale) and 20 items 
using a five-point Likert scale assessing their attitudes toward dementia 
(Dementia Attitudes Scale) was used. The tools were validated with 60 students 
and showed good internal reliability.
FINDINGS: Senior nursing students exhibited insufficient knowledge of dementia 
(mean score of 20.82 ± 2.96 out of 34) but demonstrated positive attitudes 
toward dementia care (mean score of 65.54 ± 8.25 out of 90). Engaging in a 
4-year diploma program (β = 0.501), being female (β = 0.827), and achieving 
greater academic performance (β = 0.795) were positively associated with 
increased knowledge of dementia (P < 0.05). Being female (β = 2.179) and 
possessing better knowledge of dementia (β = 2.740) also positively affected 
nursing students' attitudes toward dementia (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The study is the first to shed light on the gaps in dementia 
knowledge among senior nursing students in Vietnam. It also provides a 
comparison in dementia knowledge and attitudes between students enrolling in 
3-year versus 4-year nursing diploma programs. Educational strategies are needed 
to not only equip students with adequate knowledge and reinforced positive 
attitudes toward dementia, but to strengthen nursing graduates' knowledge and 
attititudes of dementia to better their capacity in ageing and dementia care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The findings highlighted the need to enhance 
training programs to meet the growing demand for dementia care. Additional 
post-graduation training activities are also recommended to increase 
competencies of nurses in caring for PWD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairments and is considered the 
most prevalent form of dementia. Among the contributing factors to AD lies the 
hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Phosphorylated 
tau reduces its affinity for microtubules and triggers other posttranslational 
modifications that result in its aggregation and assembly into filaments. These 
structures progressively accumulate within neurons leading to neurodegeneration. 
While current AD medications often involve undesirable side effects, the 
exploration of natural products as a potential therapeutic alternative has 
gained considerable attention. Numerous compounds have shown potential capacity 
for reducing tau pathology through different mechanisms, such as inhibiting 
kinases to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation, enhancing phosphatase activity, and 
blocking fibril formation. Since tau hyperphosphorylation-induced aggregation is 
pivotal in AD onset, this review aims to elucidate the potential of natural 
products in modulating this crucial molecular mechanism.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disease and the leading cause of dementia. Recent research highlights meningeal 
lymphatics as key regulators in neurological diseases, suggesting that enhancing 
their drainage function could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. Our 
proof-of-concept study demonstrated that cranial bone transport can improve 
meningeal lymphatic drainage function and promote ischemic stroke recovery.
METHODS: This study defined cranial bone maneuver (CBM) technique. After 
osteotomy, a small circular bone flap was made and attached to an external 
fixator for subsequent maneuver in a controlled fashion for a defined period 
using 5xFAD mice.
RESULTS: CBM treatment improved memory functions, reduced amyloid deposits, and 
promoted meningeal lymphatic drainage function. CBM induced cascades of 
inflammatory and lymphangiogenic processes in skull and meninges. Meningeal 
lymphatics are indispensable elements for the therapeutic effects of CBM.
DISCUSSION: CBM might be a promising innovative therapy for AD management, 
warranting further clinical investigation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cranial bone maneuver (CBM) alleviated memory deficits and amyloid 
depositions. CBM promoted meningeal lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic drainage 
function. The beneficial effects of CBM lasted for a long time following the CBM 
procedures. CBM induced cascades of inflammatory and lymphangiogenic processes 
in the meninges. Meningeal lymphatic vessels are indispensable elements for CBM 
therapeutic effects.

INTRODUCTION: The phase 3 trial CLARITY AD found lecanemab slowed cognitive 
decline by 27%. However, subgroup analyses indicated a significant 31% sex 
difference in the effect and suggested no or limited effectiveness in females. 
We used simulations constrained by the trial design to determine whether that 
difference reflects a pre-existing sex difference in Alzheimer's disease 
progression or was a random event.
METHODS: Simulations were generated using linear mixed models of cognitive 
decline fit to data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
participants satisfying CLARITY AD inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The statistically non-significant 7.9% smaller cognitive decline rate 
in our cohort's males versus females does not explain CLARITY AD's 31% sex 
difference in lecanemab's effect. A ≥ 31% difference occurred randomly in only 
12 of our 10,000 simulations (0.0012 probability).
DISCUSSION: CLARITY AD's sex difference was probably not random. Lecanemab is 
likely less effective in females than males, but we cannot conclude the drug is 
ineffective in females.
HIGHLIGHTS: Lecanemab is more clinically effective in males than in females. 
Forest plots should only report subgroup-specific effects in well-powered 
subgroups. Trial simulations based on real data enable investigation of subgroup 
drug effects. We cannot conclude that lecanemab is clinically ineffective in 
females. A sex difference in lecanemab's efficacy could be linked to its action 
mechanism.

INTRODUCTION: We report biomarker treatment effects in the GRADUATE I and II 
phase 3 studies of gantenerumab in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET), volumetric magnetic 
resonance imaging (vMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma biomarkers used 
to assess gantenerumab treatment related changes on neuropathology, 
neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation over 116 weeks.
RESULTS: Gantenerumab reduced amyloid PET load, CSF biomarkers of amyloid beta 
(Aβ)40, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), neurogranin, S100 
calcium-binding protein B (S100B), neurofilament light (NfL), alpha-synuclein 
(α-syn), neuronal pentraxin-2 (NPTX2), and plasma biomarkers of t-tau, p-tau181, 
p-tau217, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) while increasing plasma 
Aβ40, Aβ42. vMRI showed increased reduction in whole brain volume and increased 
ventricular expansion, while hippocampal volume was unaffected. Tau PET showed 
no treatment effect.
DISCUSSION: Robust treatment effects were observed for multiple biomarkers in 
GRADUATE I and II. Comparison across anti-amyloid antibodies indicates utility 
of p-tau and GFAP as biomarkers of amyloid plaque removal while NfL and tau PET 
seem unsuitable as consistent indicators of clinical efficacy. vMRI might be 
confounded by non-neurodegenerative brain volume changes. TRIAL REGISTRATION 
NUMBER (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER): NCT03444870 and NCT03443973.
HIGHLIGHTS: Gantenerumab significantly reduced brain amyloid load. Tau positron 
emission tomography showed no treatment effect in a small subset of 
participants. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging showed increased whole brain 
volume reduction under treatment while hippocampal volume was unaffected. Robust 
treatment effects on cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers were found, 
despite lack of clinical efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a developing public health concern in aging 
communities that affects a sizable section of the global population. The risk of 
Alzheimer's disease increases with age; it affects one-third of males and 
two-thirds of women. This research attempts to assess the effect of 
nano-selenium and thymoquinone on Nrf2 gene expression levels in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: There were five identical groups of 50 albino male rats: a control 
group that was healthy; an AD positive control group; an AD group that received 
nano-selenium (5 mg/kg); an AD group that received thymoquinone (2 mg/kg); and 
an AD group that received both. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The 
levels of Nrf2 in brain tissues were evaluated using real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Nrf2 mean expression levels in the nano-selenium-treated rats, the 
thymoquinone-treated rats, and the rats that were given both treatments all 
increased significantly compared to AD rats with no treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that nano-selenium and thymoquinone elevated Nrf2 
gene expression levels in AD.

Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common dementia causing 
cognitive decline. Nrf2 signaling may be a potential therapeutic target, while 
thymoquinone and nano-selenium could be effective neuroprotective agents for AD 
management, potentially reducing neuronal damage. In this study, the effects of 
thymoquinone and nano-selenium treatments on AD rat models were evaluated 
through behavior study by performing the Morris Water Maze test, estimation of 
different markers (Nrf2, Aβ-42, GSH, MDA, and TNF-α), and histopathological 
examination of brain tissue.

Elder mistreatment occurs in as many as one-half of the 11 million family care 
partnerships with persons living with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias 
(AD/ADRD) in the United States. Knowledge and Interpersonal Skills to Develop 
Enhanced Relationships is an 8-week psychoeducational intervention to prevent 
psychological mistreatment among family caregivers to persons living with 
dementia by building healthy caregiving relationships. The investigators 
conducted a single-arm pre- and posttest study to assess KINDER's feasibility. A 
total of 45 caregivers enrolled, among whom 37 completed the follow-up survey 
(82.2% retention). Caregivers attended an average of 2.1 of 3 discussion 
sessions (SD = 0.76). Paired t-test analyses comparing outcomes at baseline and 
post-intervention demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in 
psychological mistreatment and relationship strain, and an increase in 
resourcefulness skills. These findings suggest KINDER is a feasible low- to 
moderate-intensity intervention to prevent psychological mistreatment with 
AD/ADRD caregiving. Future research will test KINDER's efficacy.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is 
characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and β-amyloid 
plaques, leading to a decline in cognitive function. AD is characterized by tau 
protein hyperphosphorylation and extracellular β-amyloid accumulation. Even 
after much research, there are still no proven cures for AD. The 
neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant qualities of melatonin, a 
hormone mostly produced by the pineal gland, have drawn interest as a possible 
treatment option for AD. This study looks at new evidence that suggests 
melatonin overexpression to be a promising therapy option for AD. Melatonin 
levels naturally decline with age and decrease more significantly in individuals 
with AD, worsening neurodegenerative processes. Melatonin has therapeutic 
potential as it inhibits Aβ formation, prevents amyloid fibril extension through 
structure-dependent interactions, and protects neurons from Aβ-induced toxicity. 
Melatonin promotes neurogenesis, which is decreased in AD, suggesting it may 
treat the disease's many pathologies. The review emphasizes the importance of 
melatonin's mechanisms of action, including its capacity to reduce 
neuroinflammation, regulate mitochondrial function, scavenge free radicals, and 
influence apoptotic pathways. As research into AD continues, this article 
provides a forward-looking perspective on how future studies could leverage 
melatonin's multifaceted neuroprotective properties to develop more effective 
treatments for AD.

BACKGROUND: Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has been implicated in 
cross-organ protection in cerebrovascular disease, including stroke. However, 
the lack of a consensus protocol and controversy over the clinical therapeutic 
outcomes of RIC suggest an inadequate mechanistic understanding of RIC. The 
current study identifies RIC-induced molecular and cellular events in the blood, 
which enhance long-term functional recovery in experimental cerebral ischemia.
METHODS: Naive mice or mice subjected to transient ischemic stroke were randomly 
selected to receive sham conditioning or RIC in the hindlimb at 2 hours 
post-stroke. At 3 days post-stroke, monocyte composition in the blood was 
analyzed, and brain tissue was examined for monocyte-derived macrophage (Mφ), 
levels of efferocytosis, and CD36 expression. Mouse with a specific deletion of 
CD36 in monocytes/Mφs was used to establish the role of CD36 in RIC-mediated 
modulation of efferocytosis, transneuronal degeneration, and recovery following 
stroke.
RESULTS: RIC applied 2 hours after stroke increased the entry of monocytes into 
the injured brain. In the postischemic brain, Mφ had increased levels of CD36 
expression and efferocytosis. These changes in brain Mφ were derived from 
RIC-induced changes in circulating monocytes. In the blood, RIC increased CD36 
expression in circulating monocytes and shifted monocytes to a proinflammatory 
Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex (LY6C)High state. Conditional deletion of CD36 in 
Mφ abrogated the RIC-induced monocyte shift in the blood and efferocytosis in 
the brain. During the recovery phase of stroke, RIC rescued the loss of the 
volume and of tyrosine hydroxylase+ neurons in substantia nigra and behavioral 
deficits in wild-type mice but not in mice with a specific deletion of CD36 in 
monocytes/Mφs.
CONCLUSIONS: RIC induces a shift in monocytes to a proinflammatory state with 
elevated CD36 levels, and this is associated with CD36-dependent efferocytosis 
in Mφs that rescues delayed transneuronal degeneration in the postischemic brain 
and promotes stroke recovery. Together, these findings provide novel insight 
into our mechanistic understanding of how RIC improves poststroke recovery.

BACKGROUND: We previously reported that social restrictions due to the COVID-19 
pandemic led to a decline in cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer 
disease (AD). Here, we assessed the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on the 
activities of daily living (ADL) and disease severity in patients by comparing 
them to a control group.
METHODS: We examined the impact on ADL, evaluated using disability assessment 
for dementia (DAD), and disease severity, evaluated using the ABC dementia 
scale, in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. We conducted a post hoc subgroup 
analysis of a double-blinded, noninferiority study of donepezil 27.5 mg patches 
and donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg tablets (JapicCTI-194582). After showing the 
noninferiority of both treatments, we combined the data from both groups for 
analysis.
RESULTS: The subpopulation of the per-protocol set grouped by completing the 
double-blinded evaluation before and on/after the mild lockdown was balanced 
(n=136 and n=120). Patient demographics were similar between the subgroups. The 
decline in the DAD and ABC dementia scale scores [least-squares mean (SE)] was 
ameliorated by social restriction [-3.810 (0.743) and -1.871 (0.697) and -1.147 
(0.285) and -0.419 (0.267), respectively (not significant)].
CONCLUSION: Normalcy and expectation biases can affect the evaluation of ADL and 
disease severity by caregivers under high stress and deterioration of mental 
conditions.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Division of Behavioral Neurology, Stanford 
Neuroscience Health Center, 453 Quarry Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical, 
radiological, and neuropathological heterogeneity of corticobasal syndrome 
(CBS), which can complicate the determination of underlying etiology and lead to 
inaccurate treatment decisions. Though the most common diagnosis is corticobasal 
degeneration (CBD), the spectrum of underlying pathologies expands beyond CBD 
and can overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases and even the 
neuroimmunology field. We will review possible clinical presentations and cues 
that can point towards the etiology. We will also discuss the most recent 
available biomarkers to facilitate a more accurate diagnosis. Additionally, we 
will examine current and future potential therapeutic options.
RECENT FINDINGS: The range of available fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers is 
increasing and some are already being used in clinical practice. While the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is largely aimed at managing symptoms, 
early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for initiating early 
management and enrollment in clinical trials. The recent approval of a 
disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised hopes for the 
development of more therapeutic options for other proteinopathies. Several 
candidates are currently being studied in clinical trial pipelines, particularly 
those targeting tau pathology.
SUMMARY: Recent advancements in understanding the genetic and neuropathological 
diversity of CBS, along with the promising development of fluid and imaging 
biomarkers, are driving clinical trial research forward, instilling optimism for 
creating more effective disease-modifying treatments for brain proteinopathies.

INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta42/amyloid beta40 (Aβ42/Aβ40) and 
phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) identify individuals with primary Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). They may detect AD co-pathology in the setting of other primary 
neurodegenerative diseases, but this has not been systematically studied.
METHODS: We compared the clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological 
associations of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 (mass spectrometry), p-tau217 
(electrochemiluminescence), and neurofilament light ([NfL], single molecule 
array [Simoa]), as markers of AD co-pathology, in a sporadic frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD) cohort (n = 620).
RESULTS: Aβ42/Aβ40 showed no clinicopathological associations. High p-tau217 was 
present in amnestic dementia (AmD) presumed to be due to FTD, logopenic primary 
progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and APOEε4 carriers, and correlated with worse 
baseline and longitudinal clinical scores, lower hippocampal volumes, and more 
severe AD co-pathology (Braak Stage). NfL was elevated in all FTD phenotypes, 
and correlated with clinical scores and frontotemporal brain volumes.
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 has clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological 
correlates in sporadic FTD and may identify FTD cases with AD co-pathology.
HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) features could be identified with plasma 
phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration 
(FTLD).Plasma p-tau217 is a better discriminator of AD co-pathology and 
AD-associated features in FTLD than plasma amyloid beta42/amyloid beta40 
(Aβ42/Aβ40) and neurofilament light (NfL).In FTLD, plasma p-tau217, but not 
Aβ42/Aβ40 or neurofilament light, has phenotypical, neurocognitive, and 
neuroimaging correlates suggestive of AD co-pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Blood-based glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament 
light chain (NfL), and phosphorylated tau (pTau) have shown promising prognostic 
potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their applicability in clinical 
settings where comorbidities are prevalent remains uncertain.
METHODS: Simoa assays quantified GFAP, NfL, and pTau181 in retrospectively 
retrieved prediagnostic serum samples from 102 AD patients and 21 non-AD 
controls.
RESULTS: Higher serum GFAP levels predicted earlier clinical presentation and 
faster subsequent Mini-Mental State Examination decline in AD patients. Serum 
NfL levels were increased in patients with arterial hypertension (AHT), kidney 
dysfunction, and a history of stroke and only demonstrated predictive value for 
time to clinical AD presentation after adjustment for these comorbidities. Serum 
pTau181 instability during long-term storage at -20°C prevented its prognostic 
evaluation in retrospectively retrieved serum samples.
DISCUSSION: Serum GFAP is a robust prognostic marker for AD progression, whereas 
NfL is impacted by various comorbidities, which complicates the interpretation 
of its prognostic value.
HIGHLIGHTS: Serum GFAP levels predict time to clinical AD presentation.Serum NfL 
levels are increased by hypertension, kidney disease, and stroke 
history.Prognostic value of serum NfL in AD is only evident after comorbidity 
correction.Serum levels of GFAP, but not NfL, increase over time within 
prediagnostic AD stages.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence links amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation with 
inflammation. This pilot study investigated the use of an immunoassay panel to 
map biomarker changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we 
evaluated the stability of protein quantification after multiple freeze-thaw 
cycles (FTCs).
METHODS: The nucleic acid-linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) inflammation 
panel measured 203 proteins in serum samples of individuals with (n = 31) and 
without (n = 31) AD pathology. Linear models, adjusted for age and sex, 
contrasted protein expression across groups.
RESULTS: After multiple-testing adjustments, glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(p < 0.001) and S100A12 (p < 0.001) were significantly changed in the presence 
of AD pathology. Furthermore, they correlated with cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers (phosphorylated tau-181 [p-tau181], tau, and Aβ42). Additional 
markers were nominally changed between groups. Five FTCs caused minimal changes 
in measurements with the NULISA inflammation panel.
DISCUSSION: Monitoring of inflammation in AD, using the 200-plex NULISA panel, 
demonstrates changes in peripherally circulating inflammation-related proteins. 
Contrary to previous reports, FTCs had minimal impact on the quantification of 
inflammatory markers.
HIGHLIGHTS: The novel nucleic acid-linked immuno-sandwich assay (NULISA) 
inflammation panel, which includes 200 protein biomarkers, was used.The panel 
was used for the first time in serum from patients with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).The protein S100A12 was identified as a potential biomarker for 
AD.Inflammation markers were stable in up to five freeze-thaw cycles.

BACKGROUND: This study explores the impact of sleep disturbances on gray matter 
structural covariance networks (SCNs) across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
continuum.
METHODS: Amyloid-negative participants served as controls, whereas amyloid 
positive (A+) individuals were categorized into six groups based on cognitive 
status and sleep quality. SCNs for the default mode network (DMN), salience 
network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) were derived from T1-weighted 
magnetic resonance images.
RESULTS: In the DMN, increased structural associations were observed in 
cognitive unimpaired (CU) A+ and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups 
regardless of sleep quality, whereas AD with poor sleep (PS) showed a decrease 
and AD with normal sleep (NS) an increase. For the ECN, AD-NS showed increased 
and AD-PS showed reduced associations. In the SN, reduced associations were 
observed in CU A+ NS and MCI-NS, whereas AD-NS displayed increased associations; 
only AD-PS had decreased associations.
CONCLUSION: Distinct SCN damage patterns between normal and poor sleepers 
provide insights into sleep disturbances in AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: We delineated distinct patterns of structural covariance networks 
(SCN) impairment across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, uncovering 
significant disparities between individuals with normal sleep architecture and 
those afflicted by sleep disturbances.These observations underscore the pivotal 
importance of addressing sleep disruptions in AD therapeutics, providing a 
refined understanding of their detrimental impact on brain networks implicated 
in the disease.Our investigation epitomizes methodological precision by 
constructing an AD continuum using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to minimize diagnostic heterogeneity, 
further enhanced by a substantial cohort size that bolsters the robustness and 
generalizability of our findings.

Alzheimer's disease is a disabling neurodegenerative disorder for which no 
effective treatment currently exists. To predict the diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
disease could be crucial for patients' outcome, but current Alzheimer's disease 
biomarkers are invasive, time consuming or expensive. Thus, developing MRI-based 
computational methods for Alzheimer's disease early diagnosis would be essential 
to narrow down the phenotypic measures predictive of cognitive decline. Amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is associated with higher risk for Alzheimer's 
disease, and here, we aimed to identify MRI-based quantitative rules to predict 
aMCI to possible Alzheimer's disease conversion, applying different machine 
learning algorithms sequentially. At baseline, T1-weighted brain images were 
collected for 104 aMCI patients and processed to obtain 146 volumetric measures 
of cerebral grey matter regions [regions of interest (ROIs)]. One year later, 
patients were classified as converters (aMCI-c = 32) or non-converters, i.e. 
clinically and neuropsychologically stable (aMCI-s = 72) based on cognitive 
performance. Feature selection was performed by random forest (RF), and the 
identified seven ROIs volumetric data were used to implement support vector 
machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Both SVM and DT 
reached an average accuracy of 86% in identifying aMCI-c and aMCI-s. DT found a 
critical threshold volume of the right entorhinal cortex (EC-r) as the first 
feature for differentiating aMCI-c/aMCI-s. Almost all aMCI-c had an EC-r volume 
<1286 mm3, while more than half of the aMCI-s patients had a volume above the 
identified threshold for this structure. Other key regions for the 
classification between aMCI-c/aMCI-s were the left lateral occipital (LOC-l), 
the middle temporal gyrus and the temporal pole cortices. Our study reinforces 
previous evidence suggesting that the morphometry of the EC-r and LOC-l best 
predicts aMCI to Alzheimer's disease conversion. Further investigations are 
needed prior to deeming our findings as a broadly applicable predictive 
framework. However, here, a first indication was derived for volumetric 
thresholds that, being easy to obtain, may assist in early identification of 
Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice, thus contributing to establishing MRI 
as a useful non-invasive prognostic instrument for dementia onset.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a phenotypically and pathologically 
heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder. This heterogeneity can be studied and 
disentangled using data-driven clustering techniques.
METHODS: We implemented a self-organizing map clustering algorithm on baseline 
volumetric MRI measures from nine brain regions of interest (ROIs) to cluster 
1041 individuals enrolled in the placebo arm of the EXPEDITION3 trial. 
Volumetric MRI differences were compared among clusters. Demographics as well as 
baseline and longitudinal cognitive performance metrics were used to evaluate 
cluster characteristics.
RESULTS: Three distinct clusters, with an overall silhouette coefficient of 
0.491, were identified based on MRI volumetrics. Cluster 1 (N = 400) had the 
largest baseline volumetric measures across all ROIs and the best cognitive 
performance at baseline. Cluster 2 (N = 269) had larger hippocampal and medial 
temporal lobe volumes, but smaller parietal lobe volumes in comparison with the 
third cluster (N = 372). Significant between-group mean differences were 
observed between Clusters 1 and 2 (difference, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.85 to 2.91; P < 
0.001), Clusters 1 and 3 (difference, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.44; P < 0.001), 
but not between Clusters 2 and 3 (difference, 0.45; 95% CI, -0.11 to 1.02; P = 
0.146) in ADAS-14.
CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric MRI can be used to identify homogenous clusters of 
amyloid positive individuals with mild dementia. The groups identified differ in 
baseline and longitudinal characteristics. Cluster 1 shows little ADAS-14 change 
over the first 40 weeks of study on placebo treatment and may be unsuitable for 
identifying early benefits of treatment.

For many decades, Alzheimer's disease research has primarily focused on 
impairments within cortical and hippocampal regions, which are thought to be 
related to cognitive dysfunctions such as memory and language deficits. The 
exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is still under debate, making it challenging 
to establish an effective therapy or early diagnosis. It is widely accepted that 
the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide in the brain parenchyma leads to 
synaptic dysfunction, a critical step in Alzheimer's disease development. The 
traditional amyloid cascade model is initiated by accumulating extracellular 
amyloid-beta in brain areas essential for memory and language. However, while it 
is possible to reduce the presence of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain with 
newer immunotherapies, cognitive symptoms do not necessarily improve. 
Interestingly, recent studies support the notion that early alterations in 
subcortical brain regions also contribute to brain damage and precognitive 
decline in Alzheimer's disease. A body of recent evidence suggests that early 
Alzheimer's disease is associated with alterations (e.g., motivation, anxiety, 
and motor impairment) in subcortical areas, such as the striatum and amygdala, 
in both human and animal models. Also, recent data indicate that intracellular 
amyloid-beta appears early in subcortical regions such as the nucleus accumbens, 
locus coeruleus, and raphe nucleus, even without extracellular amyloid plaques. 
The reported effects are mainly excitatory, increasing glutamatergic 
transmission and neuronal excitability. In agreement, data in Alzheimer's 
disease patients and animal models show an increase in neuronal synchronization 
that leads to electroencephalogram disturbances and epilepsy. The data indicate 
that early subcortical brain dysfunctions might be associated with non-cognitive 
symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, and motivation deficits, which precede 
memory loss and language alterations. Overall, the evidence reviewed suggests 
that subcortical brain regions could explain early dysfunctions and perhaps be 
targets for therapies to slow disease progression. Future research should focus 
on these non-traditional brain regions to reveal early pathological alterations 
and underlying mechanisms to advance our understanding of Alzheimer's disease 
beyond the traditionally studied hippocampal and cortical circuits.

Alzheimer's disease is the primary cause of dementia and imposes a significant 
socioeconomic burden globally. Physical exercise, as an effective strategy for 
improving general health, has been largely reported for its effectiveness in 
slowing neurodegeneration and increasing brain functional plasticity, 
particularly in aging brains. However, the underlying mechanisms of exercise in 
cognitive aging remain largely unclear. Adiponectin, a cell-secreted protein 
hormone, has recently been found to regulate synaptic plasticity and mediate the 
antidepressant effects of physical exercise. Studies on the neuroprotective 
effects of adiponectin have revealed potential innovative treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease. Here, we reviewed the functions of adiponectin and its 
receptor in the brains of human and animal models of cognitive impairment. We 
summarized the role of adiponectin in Alzheimer's disease, focusing on its 
impact on energy metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation. We also 
discuss how exercise increases adiponectin secretion and its potential benefits 
for learning and memory. Finally, we highlight the latest research on chemical 
compounds that mimic exercise-enhanced secretion of adiponectin and its receptor 
in Alzheimer's disease.

Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in Lewy body diseases (LBDs) has been observed 
since the initial descriptions of patients by James Parkinson. Recent 
experimental and human observational studies raise the possibility that 
pathogenic alpha-synuclein (⍺-syn) might develop in the GI tract and 
subsequently spread to susceptible brain regions. The cellular and mechanistic 
origins of ⍺-syn propagation in disease are under intense investigation. 
Experimental LBD models have implicated important contributions from the 
intrinsic gut microbiome, the intestinal immune system, and environmental 
toxicants, acting as triggers and modifiers to GI pathologies. Here, we review 
the primary clinical observations that link GI dysfunctions to LBDs. We first 
provide an overview of GI anatomy and the cellular repertoire relevant for 
disease, with a focus on luminal-sensing cells of the intestinal epithelium 
including enteroendocrine cells that express ⍺-syn and make direct contact with 
nerves. We describe interactions within the GI tract with resident microbes and 
exogenous toxicants, and how these may directly contribute to ⍺-syn pathology 
along with related metabolic and immunological responses. Finally, critical 
knowledge gaps in the field are highlighted, focusing on pivotal questions that 
remain some 200 years after the first descriptions of GI tract dysfunction in 
LBDs. We predict that a better understanding of how pathophysiologies in the gut 
influence disease risk and progression will accelerate discoveries that will 
lead to a deeper overall mechanistic understanding of disease and potential 
therapeutic strategies targeting the gut-brain axis to delay, arrest, or prevent 
disease progression.

The ApoE ε4 allele (APOEε4) is a major genetic risk factor for sporadic 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is linked to demyelination and cognitive decline. 
However, its effects on the lipid transporters apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and fatty 
acid-binding protein 7 (Fabp7), which are crucial for the maintenance of myelin 
in white matter (WM) during the progression of AD remain underexplored. To 
evaluate the effects of APOEε4 on ApoE, Fabp7 and myelin in the WM of the 
frontal cortex (FC), we examined individuals carrying one ε4 allele that came to 
autopsy with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild to moderate AD compared with 
non-carrier counterparts. ApoE, Fabp7 and Olig2 immunostaining was used to 
visualize cells, whereas myelin basic protein (MBP) immunocytochemistry and 
luxol fast blue (LFB) histochemistry of myelin in the WM of the FC were combined 
with quantitative morphometry. We observed increased numbers of ApoE-positive 
astrocytes in the WM of both NCI and MCI APOEε4 carriers compared with 
non-carriers, whereas Fabp7-positive cells were elevated only in AD. Conversely, 
Olig2 cell counts and MBP immunostaining decreased in MCI APOEε4 carriers 
compared to non-carriers, while LFB levels were higher in NCI APOEε4 carriers 
compared to non-carriers. Although no correlations were found between ApoE, 
Fabp7, and cognitive status, LFB measurements were positively correlated with 
perceptual speed, global cognition, and visuospatial scores in APOEε4 carriers 
across clinical groups. The present findings suggest that the ε4 allele 
compromises FC myelin homeostasis by disrupting the lipid transporters ApoE, 
Fabp7 and myelination early in the onset of AD. These data support targeting 
cellular components related to WM integrity as possible treatments for AD.

Previous studies have suggested that systemic viral infections may increase 
risks of dementia. Whether this holds true for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infections is unknown. Determining this is 
important for anticipating the potential future incidence of dementia. To begin 
to do this, we measured plasma biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's disease 
pathology in the UK Biobank before and after serology-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with biomarkers associated with 
β-amyloid pathology: reduced plasma Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and, in more vulnerable 
participants, lower plasma Aβ42 and higher plasma pTau-181. The plasma biomarker 
changes were greater in participants who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 or 
had reported hypertension previously. We showed that the changes in biomarkers 
were linked to brain structural imaging patterns associated with Alzheimer's 
disease, lower cognitive test scores and poorer overall health evaluations. Our 
data from this post hoc case-control matched study thus provide observational 
biomarker evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with greater 
brain β-amyloid pathology in older adults. While these results do not establish 
causality, they suggest that SARS-CoV-2 (and possibly other systemic 
inflammatory diseases) may increase the risk of future Alzheimer's disease.

Cerebral accumulation of alpha-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates is the hallmark event 
in a group of neurodegenerative diseases-collectively called 
synucleinopathies-which include Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies 
and multiple system atrophy. Currently, these are diagnosed by their clinical 
symptoms and definitively confirmed postmortem by the presence of αSyn deposits 
in the brain. Here, we summarize the drawbacks of the current clinical 
definition of synucleinopathies and outline the rationale for moving toward an 
earlier, biology-anchored definition of these disorders, with or without the 
presence of clinical symptoms. We underscore the utility of the αSyn seed 
amplification assay to detect aggregated αSyn in living patients and to 
differentiate between neuronal or glial αSyn pathology. We anticipate that a 
biological definition of synucleinopathies, if well-integrated with the current 
clinical classifications, will enable further understanding of the disease 
pathogenesis and contribute to the development of effective, disease-modifying 
therapies.

We previously demonstrated that the inability of primary endothelial cilia to 
sense fluid shear stress can lead to nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and cause 
hypertension (HTN). Decreased biosynthesis of NO contributes to cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients through increased deposition of 
amyloid beta (Aβ). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis 
of HTN and AD are incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to 
examine the pathophysiological roles of vascular primary cilia and muscarinic 
acetylcholine receptor 3 (CHRM3) in HTN and AD. We discovered, for the first 
time, that CHRM3 was localized to primary cilia of endothelial and 
cerebrovascular cells, and that CHRM3 expression was downregulated in cilialess 
cells. Moreover, CHRM3 activation enhanced cilia length and sensory function in 
terms of eNOS activation. To further examine the role of vascular CHRM3 in vivo, 
we showed that endothelial CHRM3 knockout was associated with increased BP and 
attenuated acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation. In addition, endothelial 
CHRM3 knockout resulted in altered fear behavior. This demonstrates the 
physiological significance of endothelial CHRM3 signaling and primary 
cilia-derived NO production as an important mechanism in the control of BP and 
cognition.

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) shape brain function through many 
non-canonical regulatory mechanisms beyond myelination. Here we show that OPCs 
form contacts with their processes on neuronal somata in a neuronal 
activity-dependent manner. These contacts facilitate exocytosis of neuronal 
lysosomes. A reduction in the number or branching of OPCs reduces these 
contacts, which is associated with lysosome accumulation and altered metabolism 
in neurons and more senescent neurons with age. A similar reduction in OPC 
branching and neuronal lysosome accumulation is seen in an early-stage mouse 
model of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings have implications for the prevention 
of age-related pathologies and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer are multifactorial diseases with significant 
health consequences, and their relationship with aging makes them particularly 
challenging. Epidemiological data suggests that individuals with DM are more 
susceptible to certain cancers. This study examined the bioactive properties of 
Hypericum scabrum extracts, including methanol, hexane, and others, focusing on 
their inhibitory effects on key enzymes associated with DM and neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, α-amylase, and 
α-glucosidase. Additionally, the impact of these extracts on human fibroblast 
(HDFa) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cancer cells was evaluated. The methanol extract 
was analyzed for elemental composition using ICP-MS, secondary metabolites, and 
amino acids via LC-MS/MS and underwent morphological and anatomical 
characterization. The methanol extract demonstrated notable inhibitory activity, 
with an IC50 value of < 1 µg/mL against α-glucosidase, surpassing acarbose in 
efficacy. The flower essential oil exhibited the highest inhibition (79.95%) of 
butyrylcholinesterase and the strongest acetylcholinesterase inhibition 
(21.62%). Elemental analysis revealed high concentrations of Na and K, while 
quinic acid and proline were identified as major metabolites, with proline 
concentrations reaching 494.0482 nmol/mL in the aerial part extract. The 
anticancer assays revealed higher cytotoxicity in U87MG glioblastoma cells 
compared to HDFa fibroblasts, suggesting potential applications for cancer 
therapy. The plant grows 20-50 cm tall, with yellow flowers and ovoid-ribbed 
capsules containing brown, reniform seeds. Its leaves are amphistomatic and 
ornamented, while stems feature striate cuticles and paracytic stomata. The 
pollen grains are microreticulate with syncolporate apertures. These results 
underscore the promising therapeutic potential of H. scabrum in managing DM, 
cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, with its ability to inhibit key enzymes 
and show selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells.

The multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) strategy has been evolved as the 
propitious approach for the development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). In an earlier report, we described the novel series of chalcone 
derivatives bearing N-aryl piperazine scaffold as MTDLs for the treatment of AD. 
Herein, we report the lead optimization of the series culminating in potent, 
multi-targeting compounds (32-57), evaluated through in-vitro and in-vivo 
biological studies. The optimal compound 48 exhibited potent inhibitory 
activities against AChE (IC50 = 2.89 ± 0.706 μM), BuChE 
(IC50 = 0.151 ± 0.089 μM), along with BACE-1 (% inhibition = 36.64 ± 1.343 %) 
and amyloid-β aggregation inhibition. Compound 48 showed excellent blood-brain 
barrier permeability (Pe = 7.28 ± 0.474 × 10-6 cm s-1) in PAMPA assay and was 
found safe in the in vivo acute oral toxicity study. The molecular binding 
interaction pattern and protein-ligand stability was displayed by lead compound 
48 with selected targets. Furthermore, in-vivo behavioural studies demonstrated 
the amelioration of cognitive dysfunctions and significant memory improvement in 
Y-maze test (scopolamine-induced amnesia model) in mice on the administration of 
compound 48 at a dose of 20 mg/kg. The reduction in the level of AChE and 
increased in ACh activity was observed in ex vivo biochemical analysis. 
Moreover, compound 48 displayed antioxidant potential on measurement of catalase 
(CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activity in ex vivo analysis. We anticipate that 
compound 48, from the pyrazoline series, may be a lead molecule for the 
discovery of safe and effective therapeutic agents for AD.

Metabolic dysregulation causes diseases like diabetes and cancer, making PDKs 
attractive targets. However, a thorough investigation into the unique roles 
played by the different members of the PDK family, especially PDK3, about memory 
loss and related diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still lacking. The 
current study investigates PF's potential to reduce PDK3-associated toxicity in 
neurodegenerative illnesses, including AD. The association between PF and PDK3 
presents a significant opportunity for medication development and AD therapy 
approaches. PF efficiently suppresses PDK3 activity, as demonstrated by 
molecular docking and biophysical characterization, providing an in-depth 
understanding of their molecular interactions. PF significantly inhibited PDK3 
in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 4.88 µM. Considering 
this, the current investigation also explores the biological component of PF, 
which exhibits potential in treating AD and is primarily associated with 
neuroprotection. In the present study, a 3-hour pre-treatment of PF was 
administered at varying concentrations (4, 6, and 8 µM) in response to the 
24-hour SCP (2 mM)-mediated toxicity. Based on the results of in silico and 
biophysical characterization, it is concluded that PF inhibits the PDK3 
activity. Additionally, it can enhance cell viability, suppress ROS expression, 
impede apoptosis, and downregulate TNF-α expression. When combined, these 
actions help to prevent neuronal death in an in vitro model of SCP. PF 
strengthens the memory marker, which is confirmed through BDNF expression. This 
study found that all results were more effective at lower and moderate doses of 
PF. Our research indicates that PF boosts memory, decelerates the progression of 
oxidative stress, and could potentially serve as a dose-dependent treatment for 
AD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zuo Gui Wan (ZGW) is a well-known traditional 
Chinese medicine decoction used for approximately 400 years to treat age-related 
degenerative conditions, including cognitive impairment in older adults, 
osteoporosis, and general aging. However, the mechanism of action for ZGW 
remains unclear.
AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study aims to investigate the efficacy of ZGW in 
improving cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models and to 
explore the underlying mechanisms, presenting a novel perspective in the field.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were divided into three 
groups that received either metformin (200 mg/kg daily) or ZGW (6 and 12 g/kg 
daily). High-performance liquid chromatography was conducted for ZGW's quality 
control. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test. 
Neuronal loss, synaptic plasticity, and β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition were evaluated 
through Western blot or immunofluorescence staining. The underlying molecular 
mechanisms were investigated using ELISA, Western blot, qRT-PCR, 
co-immunoprecipitation assay, ATP assay, and cytochrome c oxidase assay.
RESULTS: ZGW, administered in both low and high doses, significantly enhanced 
cognitive performance, notably decreased neuronal loss and Aβ deposition, and 
reduced levels of Aβ1-40/42. It also inhibited excessive mitochondrial division 
primarily by suppressing phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), 
especially at high doses of ZGW. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further 
confirmed that ZGW inhibited the interaction between Aβ and p-Drp1. Furthermore, 
similar to the effects of the AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activator 
metformin, ZGW led to a marked increase in the mitochondrial DNA copy number and 
upregulated the AMPK/PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM pathway. Improvements in mitochondrial 
function were evident from the increased ATP production, elevated expression of 
superoxide dismutase 2, and upregulated cytochrome c oxidase activity. 
Additionally, the excess byproduct of reactive oxygen species, 
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, decreased in the group treated with ZGW.
CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence that ZGW improves cognitive 
impairment in APP/PS1 mice by activating AMPK/PGC-1α-regulated mitochondrial 
bioenergetics and inhibiting Aβ-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, 
highlighting its potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for AD.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Qiangji Decoction (QJD), a Chinese medicine, is 
widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat amnesia and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), showing significant anti-AD effects. However, the precise 
mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood and require more 
research.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which QJD 
ameliorates neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial impairment 
in AD through the regulation of ROCK2/Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to identify active components 
in QJD extract. The study used SAMP8 mice for AD modeling and SAMR1 mice as 
controls. Cognitive function in SAMP8 mice was assessed with the Morris Water 
Maze after following treatment with QJD and the mitochondrial fission inhibitor 
Mdivi-1. Nissl and FJB staining evaluated QJD's effect on hippocampal injury. 
Synaptic integrity was examined with Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron 
microscopy, and immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial function in hippocampal 
neurons was assessed using electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, and reagent kits. 
Western blot analyzed expression of proteins related to mitochondrial fission 
(ROCK2, Drp1, Fis1, Mff) and fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1).
RESULTS: The analysis of QJD extract via UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS led to the 
identification of 46 active compounds. In SAMP8 mice, administration of QJD 
resulted in decreased escape latency, increased platform crossings, and extended 
duration in the target quadrant. Additionally, QJD exhibited neuroprotective 
effects on the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, effectively preventing neuronal loss 
and damage. QJD also facilitated the extension and thickening of dendritic 
spines, enhanced the ultrastructure of hippocampal synapses, and upregulated 
synaptic function-related proteins, including PSD95 and SYN1. Furthermore, QJD 
ameliorated mitochondrial damage, improved mitochondrial membrane potential and 
ATP content, and reduced ROS expression in hippocampal neurons of SAMP8 mice. 
These effects were mediated through the downregulation of ROCK2, phosphorylated 
Drp1 (Ser616), Fis1, and Mff, as well as the upregulation of Mfn1, Mfn2, and 
OPA1.
CONCLUSIONS: QJD may reduce neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and 
mitochondrial impairment in SAMP8 mice by regulating mitochondrial dynamics 
through the ROCK2/Drp1 pathway.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a pivotal enzyme in nerve conduction, controlling 
its activity with its inhibitor (AChEI) is crucial for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, current AChEIs are associated with 
considerable adverse effects. Previous work has identified 
2α,3β,19α,23-tetrahydroxy-12-ene-28-oic acid (RLMS) as a promising natural 
AChEI. This study synthesized three novel series of AChEIs to elucidate the 
interaction mechanisms between the title enzyme and RLMS. Among the compounds, 1 
and 22 emerged as the most potent and selective inhibitors exhibiting both 
irreversible and mixed competitive inhibition types against AChE. Molecular 
docking studies at the AChE active sites revealed binding modes that justify its 
potent enzyme inhibitory effects. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations 
demonstrated robust and stable interactions of 1 and 22 with the binding sites 
of their target. In vitro assays showed derivates, especially 22, exhibited 
potential neuroprotective activities on H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury model. 
In vivo experiments showed that zebrafish models of AD treated with varying 
concentrations of 22 displayed obviously increased movement distance and speed, 
notably, at 25 μM level, 22 effectively reduced apoptosis in zebrafish brain 
cells. Collectively, this research delineates the intricate relationship between 
AChE and 22, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for combating AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a cholinergic deficit, prompting 
conventional therapies to elevate acetylcholine levels as a compensatory 
measure. Two main strategies involve the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) and/or the stimulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChR). Caffeine (CFF), 
known as a partial agonist of nAChR and an AChE inhibitor, acts as a cholinergic 
enhancer. Additionally, it is suggested that CFF may exhibit neuroprotective 
capabilities through the inhibition of the human adenosine receptor type 2A 
(hA2AR) in the brain's striatum, potentially preventing cellular apoptosis. This 
study explores on the design and prediction of the bioactivity of CFF analogues 
with the aim of enhancing cholinergic signaling and providing neuroprotection to 
improve their therapeutic potential. We employed tools to predict 
pharmacokinetic and bioactivity properties, molecular docking, molecular 
dynamics, and target prediction to identify potential candidates among the 
designed CFF analogues capable of enhancing neurotransmission and providing 
cellular protection. In a novel approach, a normalized index is proposed for the 
combined analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters and molecular docking 
binding affinities, which facilitates the systematic evaluation and comparison 
of the synthesized analogues and minimizes subjectivity in the selection of 
promising candidates. Results indicated that some analogues show promise in 
improving cholinergic activity and providing neuroprotection. These findings 
instill optimism, encouraging further research to corroborate their effects, 
while also representing a significant step towards the development of new 
therapeutic agents for AD.

Cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease results from a complex interplay of 
various pathological processes, including the dysregulation of key enzymes such 
as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and monoamine 
oxidase B (MAO-B). This study proposes and designs a series of novel molecules 
derived from 8-hydroxyquinoline (Azo-8HQ) as potential multi-target lead 
candidates for treating AD. An exhaustive in silico analysis was conducted, 
encompassing docking studies, ADMET analysis, density functional theory (DFT) 
studies, molecular dynamics simulations, and subsequent MM-GBSA calculations to 
examine the pharmacological potential of these molecules with the specific 
targets of interest. Out of the 63 Azo-8HQ derivatives analysed, two molecules, 
14c and 17c, demonstrated strong affinities for AChE, BuChE, and MAO-B, along 
with favourable pharmacokinetic profiles and electronic properties. Molecular 
dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of these molecules within the 
active sites of the targets, and MM-GBSA calculations revealed low binding 
energies, indicating robust interactions. These findings identify molecules 14c 
and 17c as promising multi-target candidates for the treatment of AD, based on 
an in-depth computational study aimed at minimizing drug development costs and 
time. Future work will include the synthesis of these molecules followed by 
in-depth in vitro and in vivo testing to validate their potential therapeutic 
efficacy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles, leading 
to cognitive decline and dementia. Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) is 
similar in structure to insulin and is crucial for cell growth, differentiation, 
and regulating oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, and mitochondrial 
function. IGF-1 exerts its physiological effects by binding to the IGF-1 
receptor (IGF-1R) and activating PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition to the 
physiological activities in the brain, numerous studies point to a potential 
protective role of the IGF-1 pathway in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as AD. Interestingly, patients with AD often exhibit altered 
insulin and IGF-1 levels, along with an inadequate insulin response. 
Dysregulation of IGF-1 signaling contributes to hyperphosphorylation of tau, NFT 
accumulation, increased β- and γ-secretase activity, elevated Aβ production, and 
impaired Aβ clearance, highlighting the need to explore the role of this 
signaling for potential therapeutic targets of AD. This review explores the role 
of IGF signaling in AD pathology, highlighting IGF-1 as a promising therapeutic 
target due to its significant involvement in disease mechanisms. Modulating 
IGF-1 activity could help mitigate neurodegeneration and preserve cognitive 
function in AD. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying IGF-1 
dysregulation is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to 
address the complex and multifaceted nature of AD.

BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a slowly advancing hereditary 
nerve disorder, presents a significant challenge in the medical field. Effective 
drugs for treatment are lacking, and we struggle to find sensitive markers to 
track the disease's severity and progression. In this study, our objective was 
to investigate the levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary 
acid protein (GFAP), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) and growth 
differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) in individuals with CMT and to compare them 
to a control group. Our primary goal is to determine whether these biomarker 
levels are related to the severity of the disease.
METHODS: Initially, 44 patients with CMT and 44 controls participated in this 
study. CMT diagnosis was approved by genetic testing. Disease severity was 
assessed through clinical evaluations using the CMT Neuropathy Score version 2 
(CMTNSv2). NfL and GFAP concentrations were measured using Single molecule 
array, while FGF-21 and GDF-15 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays.
RESULTS: In the group of patients with CMT, the concentrations of GDF15, FGF21, 
NfL, and GFAP were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). 
NfL and GFAP levels were correlated with the CMTNSv2 score (rs = 0.46, 
p = 0.002; rs = 0.31, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Our study has provided confirmation that plasma concentrations of 
NfL, GFAP, GDF15, and FGF21 are significantly elevated in patients with CMT 
compared to controls. Furthermore, NfL and GFAP levels were correlated with the 
clinical severity of CMT. These findings suggest that NfL and GFAP can be 
reliable disease indicators in future research.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder 
worldwide and the using of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of 
AD is increasing. The present study aims to summarize MRI in AD researches via 
bibliometric analysis and predict future research hotspots.
METHODS: We searched for records related to MRI studies in AD patients from 2004 
to 2023 in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. CiteSpace was 
applied to analyze institutions, references and keywords. VOSviewer was used for 
the analysis of countries, authors and journals.
RESULTS: A total of 13,659 articles were obtained in this study. The number of 
published articles showed overall exponential growth from 2004 to 2023. The top 
country and institution were the United States and the University of California 
System, accounting for 40.30% and 9.88% of the total studies, respectively. Jack 
CR from the United States was the most productive author. The most productive 
journal was the Journal of Alzheimers Disease. Keyword burst analysis revealed 
that "machine learning" and "deep learning" were the keywords that frequently 
appeared in the past 6 years. Timeline views of the references revealed that "#0 
tau pathology" and "#1 deep learning" are currently the latest research focuses.
CONCLUSION: This study provides an in-depth overview of publications on MRI 
studies in AD. The United States is the leading country in this field with a 
concentration of highly productive researchers and high-level institutions. The 
current research hotspot is deep learning, which is being applied to develop 
noninvasive diagnosis and safer treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment 
and behavioral impairment. The gait of AD patients is attracting the increasing 
attention. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to explore the 
effect of acupuncture on the cognitive function, gait performance, and 
hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortices.
METHODS: In this RCT, a total of 108 AD patients will be randomly assigned into 
acupuncture group or control group for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be 
three-dimensional gait analysis and cerebral hemodynamics using functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Secondary outcomes will include Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel 
Index (BI).
DISCUSSION: This trial is expected to explore the effect of acupuncture on 
cognitive function, gait performance, and hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal 
cortices for AD patients.

OBJECTIVE: Anomia is defined by difficulty in retrieving content words like 
nouns and verbs from long-term memory, independent of any impairments related to 
articulatory movements or motor speech execution. The tools for measuring 
picture naming, the conventional method for assessing anomia, are very limited 
in Turkey. The aim of this study was to adapt the Test de Dénomination de 
Québec-60 images/Quebec picture-naming test-60 pictures (TDQ-60), a color 
picture-naming test for adults and the elderly into Turkish, establish its 
validity, and develop normative data adapted to the Turkish population to 
address this gap.
METHOD: We conducted three separate studies. The objective of Study 1 was to 
culturally adapt the Test de Dénomination de Québec-60 images. In Study 2, we 
developed normative data for the TDQ-60 Tr adapted to the adult and elderly 
population in Turkey based on the performance of 414 community residents aged 
18 years and older. In Study 3, the known-group validity, the convergent 
validity, and the test-retest validity of the TDQ-60 Tr were determined.
RESULTS: The results show that the TDQ-60 Tr is reliable in distinguishing 
participants with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment from healthy 
participants. The TDQ-60 Tr measures the same cognitive construct as the Boston 
Naming Test and also has a high test-retest reliability.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the TDQ-60 Tr is a valid and reliable instrument for 
assessing naming abilities in adults and the elderly. The results of this study 
have significant implications for the assessment of naming ability in 
Turkish-speaking patients. Our work serves as a crucial connection to address 
the lack of tools for diagnosing anomia in Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Emerging research found air pollution may be associated with 
incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. However, few studies have 
examined these associations at the global scale. This study aimed to assess the 
dynamic associations between ambient air pollution and the burden of AD and 
other dementias worldwide.
METHODS: This study synthesised 149 countries/territories between 1990 and 2019. 
These data include age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of AD and other dementias, ambient air 
pollution (fine particulate matter [PM2.5], NO2 and O3 concentration) and a 
series of covariates were from various source. Average annual percentage changes 
(AAPCs) were calculated to investigate the temporal variations. Linear mixed 
models were adopted to assess the associations with single- and multi-pollutant 
separately. The associations between air pollution changes and the AD and other 
dementias were also examined using linear regression models. Stratified analyses 
by Global North-South divide and human development index were performed to 
explore the potential inequity in air pollution impacts.
RESULTS: During 1990-2019, the global ASMR, DALYs and O3 increased by 0.11%, 
0.09%, and 0.17% per year, respectively. In contrast, PM2.5 and NO2 decreased by 
0.33% and 0.14% per year, respectively. Each 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was 
associated with a 0.118 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.060 - 0.175) higher 
ASMR and 0.966 (95%CI: 0.321 - 1.611) higher DALYs after adjusting for all the 
covariates. The ASMR increased by 0.112 and the DALYs increased by 1.068 for 
each 10 µg/m3 increase in O3. The NO2-dementia associations were relatively 
weak. Stronger O3-dementia associations were found in the Global South than 
those in the Global North.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of dementia is expected to increase globally, given the 
continuously expansion of the ageing population. Air pollution was found to be 
significantly associated with a higher burden of AD and dementia. As a 
persistent challenge in urban cities, air pollution demands strict regulatory 
control.

DOPA Decarboxylase (DDC) has been proposed as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
biomarker with increased concentrations in Lewy body disorders (LBDs) and 
highest levels in patients receiving dopaminergic treatment. Here we evaluate 
plasma DDC, measured by proximity extension assay, and the effect of 
dopaminergic treatment in three independent LBD (with a focus on dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD)) cohorts: an autopsy-confirmed 
cohort (n = 71), a large multicenter, cross-dementia cohort (n = 1498) and a 
longitudinal cohort with detailed treatment information (n = 66, median 
follow-up time[IQR] = 4[4, 4] years). Plasma DDC was not altered between 
different LBDs and other disease groups or controls in absence of treatment. DDC 
levels increased over time in PD, being significantly associated to higher 
dosages of dopaminergic treatment. This emphasizes the need to consider 
treatment effect when analyzing plasma DDC, and suggests that plasma DDC, in 
contrast to CSF DDC, is of limited use as a diagnostic biomarker for LBD, but 
could be valuable for treatment monitoring.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care is often the first point of contact for 
patients with cognitive complaints, making initial cognitive screening an 
essential step to avoid delays in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) at an 
early stage. We developed MemScreen, a self-administered smartphone application 
that assesses overall cognition and verbal memory, and evaluated its ability to 
detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in both general and clinical populations.
METHODS: We conducted two validation cohort studies: (1) UK-based Whitehall II 
cohort study (13th wave, 2018-2022) involving a general population (MCI defined 
by poor performance on a global cognitive score), and (2) five French memory 
clinics involving patients without dementia (amnestic MCI defined by the Free 
and Cued Selective Reminding Test). MemScreen, MMSE, and TMT-A effectiveness was 
assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) values from unadjusted and adjusted 
logistic regression models.
RESULTS: In Whitehall II (n = 2118, mean age 75.9 years, 23.9 % women, 14.5 % 
MCI), median MemScreen completion time was 4 min 18 s. MemScreen had the highest 
AUC (0.87; 95 % CI: 0.82-0.89) for distinguishing MCI, outperforming MMSE (AUC = 
0.79; 0.76-0.82; p = 0.018) and TMT-A (AUC = 0.77; 0.74-0.80; p = 0.023). 
MemScreen sensitivity and specificity were 78.6 % and 78.7 %, respectively. In 
memory clinics (n = 303, mean age 70.5 years, 53 % women, 46.9 % amnestic MCI), 
median completion time was 5 min 17 s. MemScreen showed superior performance 
(AUC = 0.87; 0.83-0.91) compared to MMSE (AUC = 0.72; 0.67-0.78; p < 0.001) and 
TMT-A (AUC = 0.63; 0.56-0.69; p < 0.001), with 93.0 % sensitivity and 54.0 % 
specificity for amnestic MCI.
DISCUSSION: MemScreen outperformed traditional tests in identifying MCI in both 
general and clinical populations. Its self-administration and short completion 
time suggest potential as an effective screening tool to optimize memory clinic 
referrals for AD diagnosis and treatment.

Self-renewal capacity and potential to differentiate into almost any cell type 
of the human body makes pluripotent stem cells a valuable starting material for 
manufacturing of clinical grade cell therapies. Neurodegenerative diseases are 
characterized by gradual loss of structure or function of neurons, often leading 
to neuronal death. This results in gradual decline of cognitive, motor, and 
physiological functions due to the degeneration of the central nervous systems. 
Over the past two decades, comprehensive preclinical efficacy (proof-of-concept) 
and safety studies have led to the initiation of First-in-Human phase I-II 
clinical trials for a range of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we 
explore the fundamentals and challenges of neural-cell therapies derived from 
pluripotent stem cells for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we 
highlight key preclinical investigations that paved the way for regulatory 
approvals of these trials. Furthermore, we provide an overview on progress and 
status of clinical trials done so far in treating neurodegenerative diseases 
such as spinal cord injury (SCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as advances in retina diseases such as 
Stargardt disease (a.k.a fundus flavimaculatus), retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These trials will pave the way for the 
development of new cell-based therapies targeting additional neurological 
conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.

The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) gene is 
ranked as one of the top susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While 
ABCA7 mediates lipid transport across cellular membranes, ABCA7 loss of function 
has been shown to exacerbate amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and compromise microglial 
function. Our family-based study uncovered an extremely rare ABCA7 p.A696S 
variant that was substantially segregated with the development of AD in 3 
African American families. Using the knockin mouse model, we investigated the 
effects of ABCA7-A696S substitution on amyloid pathology and brain immune 
response in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Importantly, our study demonstrated that 
ABCA7-A696S substitution reduces amyloid plaque-associated microgliosis and 
increases dystrophic neurites around amyloid deposits compared to control mice. 
We also found increased X-34-positive amyloid plaque burden in 5xFAD mice with 
ABCA7-A696S substitution, while there was no evident difference in insoluble Aβ 
levels between mouse groups. Thus, ABCA7-A696S substitution may disrupt amyloid 
compaction resulting in aggravated neuritic dystrophy due to insufficient 
microglia barrier function. In addition, we observed that ABCA7-A696S 
substitution disturbs the induction of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β 
and interferon γ in the brains of 5xFAD mice, although some disease-associated 
microglia gene expression, including Trem2 and Tyrobp, are upregulated. 
Lipidomics also detected higher total lysophosphatidylethanolamine levels in the 
brains of 5xFAD mice with ABCA7-A696S substitution than controls. These results 
suggest that ABCA7-A696S substitution might compromise the adequate innate 
immune response to amyloid pathology in AD by modulating brain lipid metabolism, 
providing novel insight into the pathogenic mechanisms mediated by ABCA7. ONE 
SENTENCE SUMMARY: A rare Alzheimer's disease risk ABCA7 p.A696S variant 
compromises microglial response to amyloid pathology.

The assembly of tau into filaments defines tauopathies, a group of 
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Pick's disease 
(PiD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP). The seeded aggregation of tau has been modeled in cell culture using 
pro-aggregate modifications such as truncation of N- and C-termini and point 
mutations within the microtubule-binding repeat domain. This limits the 
applicability of research findings to sporadic disease, where aggregates contain 
wild-type, full-length tau. We describe a sensitive and specific biosensor 
assays for brain-derived tau species utilizing wild-type 0N3R and 0N4R tau 
expressed in HEK293 cells. We further generate a cell line that propagates 
AD-templated insoluble tau which is hyperphosphorylated at disease-relevant 
sites and retains a seeding profile similar to AD. We propose these systems as 
an advance over existing cell-based seeding assays, as they display specificity 
to the conformation and isoform composition of sporadic human disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically marked by tau tangles and 
beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques. It has been hypothesized that Aβ facilitates spread 
of tau outside of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), but exact mechanism of this 
facilitation remains unclear. We aimed to test the hypothesis that abnormal Aβ 
induces an increase in inter-network functional connectivity, which in turn 
induces early-stage tau elevation in limbic network. Our study used 
18F-Florbetaben Aβ positron emission tomography (PET), 18F-MK6240 tau-PET, and 
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) from 489 healthy 
unimpaired older adults, including 46 with longitudinal data. We found 
significant correlations between tau in limbic network and Aβ in distinct 
functional networks. We then demonstrated that Aβ+ /Tau- participants exhibited 
elevated inter-network functional connectivity of the limbic network. Finally, 
our longitudinal results showed that annual increases in inter-network 
functional connectivity between limbic network and default mode and control 
networks were linked to annual tau elevation in limbic network, primarily 
modulated by Aβ+ individuals. Understanding this early brain alteration in 
response to pathologies could guide treatments early in disease course.

Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers open unprecedented opportunities 
for identifying carriers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in early disease 
stages using minimally invasive techniques. Plasma p-tau biomarkers are believed 
to reflect tau phosphorylation and secretion. However, it remains unclear to 
what extent the magnitude of plasma p-tau abnormalities reflects neuronal 
network disturbance in the form of cognitive impairment. To address this 
question, we included 103 cognitively unimpaired elderly and 40 cognitively 
impaired, amyloid-β-positive individuals from the TRIAD cohort, in addition to 
336 cognitively unimpaired and 216 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β-positive 
older adults from the BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants had tau PET scans, 
amyloid PET scans or amyloid CSF, p-tau217, p-tau181 and p-tau231 blood 
measures, structural T1-MRI and cognitive assessments. In this cross-sectional 
study, we used regression models and correlation analyses to assess the 
relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores. Furthermore, we 
applied receiver operating characteristic curves to assess cognitive impairment 
across plasma biomarkers. Finally, we categorized participants into amyloid (A), 
p-tau (T1) and tau PET (T2) positive (+) or negative (-) profiles and ran 
non-parametric comparisons to assess differences across cognitive domains. We 
found that plasma p-tau217 was more associated with cognitive performance than 
p-tau181 and p-tau231 and that this relationship was particularly strong for 
memory scores (TRIAD: βp-tau217 = -0.53, βp-tau181 = -0.35 and βp-tau231 = 
-0.24; BioFINDER-2: βp-tau217 = -0.52, βp-tau181 = -0.24 and βp-tau231 = -0.29). 
Associations in amyloid-β-positive participants resembled these results, but 
other cognitive scores also showed strong associations in cognitively impaired 
individuals. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 and plasma 
p-tau231 in identifying memory impairment (area under the curve values for 
TRIAD: p-tau217 = 0.86, p-tau181 = 0.77 and p-tau231 = 0.75; and for 
BioFINDER-2: p-tau217 = 0.86, p-tau181 = 0.76 and p-tau231 = 0.81) and in 
identifying executive function impairment only in the BioFINDER-2 cohort 
(p-tau217 = 0.82, p-tau181 = 0.76 and p-tau231 = 0.76). Lastly, we showed that 
subtle memory deficits were present in A+T1+T2- participants for plasma p-tau217 
(P = 0.007) and plasma p-tau181 (P = 0.01) in the TRIAD cohort and for all 
biomarkers across cognitive domains in A+T1+T2- and A+T1+T2- individuals (P < 
0.001 in all) in the BioFINDER-2 cohort. The A+T1+T2- individuals showed 
cognitive deficits in both cohorts (P < 0.001 in all). Together, our results 
suggest that plasma p-tau217 stands out as a biomarker capable of identifying 
memory deficits attributable to Alzheimer's disease and that memory impairment 
certainly occurs in amyloid-β- and plasma p-tau-positive individuals who have no 
significant amounts of tau in the neocortex.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An adverse social exposome negatively affects many 
diseases, but its association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) survival 
is unknown. This study examined the association between the social exposome 
measure Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and ALS survival.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with ALS at the University 
of Michigan Pranger ALS Clinic diagnosed after January 1, 2012. Extracted data 
included age, sex, race, residential address, disease characteristics, and 
survival. National ADI ranking was assigned to each patient's geocoded address. 
Accelerated failure time survival analysis determined association between the 
ADI group and survival with adjustment for clinicodemographic covariates.
RESULTS: 1,085 patients (median age at diagnosis, 72 years; 45% female) met 
inclusion criteria. The highest ADI decile (most disadvantaged neighborhood 
group) was associated with 37.0% shorter survival time (95% CI -50.4% to 
-20.1%). Results were similar when grouping patients by ADI ranking (as opposed 
to decile) or including only those with a classical ALS phenotype.
DISCUSSION: Exposure to adverse social exposome, as measured by ADI, associates 
with poorer ALS survival. Because this is a single-center study, replication in 
other cohorts is encouraged. Further research is needed to understand the 
underlying mechanisms, which could influence ALS clinical care.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lipid metabolism in older adults is affected by 
various factors including biological aging, functional decline, reduced 
physiologic reserve, and nutrient intake. The dysregulation of lipid metabolism 
could adversely affect brain health. This study investigated the association 
between year-to-year intraindividual lipid variability and subsequent risk of 
cognitive decline and dementia in community-dwelling older adults.
METHODS: ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) was a randomized 
trial of aspirin, involving 19,114 participants aged 65 years and older from 
Australia and the United States who were free of dementia and major cognitive 
impairment. ASPREE-eXTension is the post-trial observational follow-up of 
participants, currently to a maximum of 11 years. This post hoc analysis 
included participants who had lipid levels measured at baseline and in years 1, 
2, and 3. Year-to-year variability in total cholesterol (TC), low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), 
and triglycerides over the first 3 years was quantified using variability 
independent of the mean. Individuals who initiated or discontinued 
lipid-lowering therapy during this period were excluded. Multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to analyze associations with incident 
dementia, adjudicated by expert panels, and cognitive impairment with no 
dementia (CIND) confirmed by a battery of cognitive tests, occurring after year 
3. A linear mixed model was used for assessing the association with changes in 4 
cognitive function domains, including global, memory, processing speed, verbal 
fluency, and a composite score from baseline to the end of follow-up.
RESULTS: The analysis included 9,846 individuals (median [interquartile range] 
age: 73.9 [71.7-77.3] years, 54.9% female). 509 incident dementia and 1,760 CIND 
events were recorded over a median follow-up of 5.8 and 5.4 years after 
variability assessment. The hazard ratios (95% CI) comparing the highest and 
lowest quartiles of TC and LDL-c variability were 1.60 (1.23-2.08) and 1.48 
(1.15-1.91) for dementia and 1.23 (1.08-1.41) and 1.27 (1.11-1.46) for CIND. 
Higher TC and LDL-c variability was also associated with a faster decline in 
global cognition, episodic memory, psychomotor speed, and the composite score 
(all p < 0.001). No strong evidence was found for an association of HDL-c and 
triglyceride variability with dementia and cognitive change.
DISCUSSION: Tracking variability of TC and LDL-c may serve as a novel biomarker 
of incident dementia and cognitive decline in older adults.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: People living with dementia experience progressive 
functional decline and increased dependence on caregivers. This study examined 
the influence of caregivers' dementia health literacy on perceptions of medical 
care preferences and advance care planning (ACP) in people living with dementia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis used data from a cross-sectional 
survey, "Care Planning for Individuals with Dementia," administered nationwide 
by Alzheimer's Disease Centers. We conducted binary, ordinal, and multinomial 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: On average, surveyed caregivers (n = 431) were 78.3 years, had 16 years 
of education, and were mainly White (88.5%). Most lived with (76.8%) and were 
the designated healthcare proxy (95.1%), with high dementia knowledge scores 
(mean = 8.4/10). As caregivers' dementia knowledge scores increased, they were 
1.27 times more likely (p = .02) to endorse comfort care. Caregivers with 
greater knowledge about severe dementia were less likely to need further 
treatment preference-related discussions (knowing a lot: odds ratio [OR] = 0.17, 
p < .001; knowing some things: OR = 0.37, p = .006). Caregivers live apart from 
patients were 2.71 times more likely to know about such discussions (p < .001). 
Caregivers of people in earlier stages endorsed greater needs for further 
conversations with clinicians (no impairment and mild cognitive impairment 
[MCI]: OR = 7.38, p = .002; mild impairment: OR = 5.32, p = .005) and their care 
recipients (no impairment and MCI: OR = 5.24, p = .02).
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings highlight the role of 
dementia-specific education in ACP discussions among people living with 
dementia, caregivers, and healthcare clinicians. These findings are important 
because evidence suggests that ACP may promote quality of life, reduce 
iatrogenic harm, minimize healthcare overutilization, and alleviate care-related 
burdens.

2-dodecyl-6-methoxycyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione (DMDD) is a cyclohexanedione 
compound extracted from the roots of Averrhoa carambola L. Several studies have 
documented its beneficial effects on diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. 
However, its potential neuroprotective effects on Parkinson's disease (PD) have 
not yet been explored. The present study aimed to investigate the protective 
effects and underlying mechanisms of DMDD in a cellular model of PD. In this 
study, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with or without DMDD following intoxication 
with the parkinsonian neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+). Cell 
viability and apoptosis were evaluated using 
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2 H-tetrazolium 
(MTS) assay and Hoechst 33,342 staining, respectively. The mitochondrial 
membrane potential (Δψm) was assessed through the JC-10 assay. The activities of 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were 
measured using WST-8 and DCFH-DA assays. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to 
explore significant biological processes and pathways influenced by DMDD. 
Molecular docking was employed to predict the domains of potential protein 
targets interacting with DMDD. Western blotting was subsequently conducted to 
determine the protein expression levels of TH, Nrf2, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, 
Beclin-1, PARP, LC3-II, LC3-I, p-PI3K, PI3K, p-mTOR and mTOR. Our study showed 
that DMDD treatment significantly increased cell viability and reduced apoptosis 
in MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, DMDD treatment reversed the loss of 
TH expression and Δψm in MPP+-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, DMDD treatment 
reduced MPP+-induced ROS production by promoting SOD activity. Additionally, 
compared with those in the MPP+ group, the protein expression levels of 
Beclin-1, Caspase-3, and PARP and the LC3II/I ratio were significantly 
decreased, whereas the protein expression levels of Nrf2 and the Bcl-2/Bax, 
p-PI3K/PI3K, and p-mTOR/mTOR ratios were significantly increased in the 
DMDD-treated group. In conclusion, DMDD protects against MPP+-induced 
cytotoxicity by mitigating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy. PI3K/mTOR 
signaling at least partly mediates the cytoprotective effect of DMDD.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Tinosinenside A (Tis A) is a novel sesquiterpene glycoside isolated from 
the dried rattan stem of Tinospora sinensis (Lour.) Merr. Tis A exhibited 
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities in vitro. However, the 
mechanism underlying the inhibition of neuroinflammation and protection of nerve 
cells remains obscure. This study used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
inflammatory response in BV2 cells to simulate a neuroinflammatory model and 
used Aβ1-42-induced HT22 cells to establish an AD cell model, aiming to 
investigate the efficacy and mechanism of Tis A through anti-neuroinflammation 
to protect nerve cells. Tis A had no effect on the proliferation of BV2 and HT22 
cells at the tested concentrations. The time- and dose-dependent effects of Tis 
A on the LPS-induced inflammatory response of BV2 cells demonstrated that the 
best anti-inflammatory efficacy appeared after 12 h of pretreatment. Tis A 
inhibited the gene levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, and IL-10 while enhancing 
the gene levels of IL-4 and TGF-β. Additionally, Tis A reduced the gene 
expression levels of CD16 and CD32 and increased the CD36 and CD206 gene 
expression levels. It also downregulated the protein expression of Iba-1 and 
iNOS while upregulating CD206. Tis A obviously inhibited NLRP3 gene and protein 
expression in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. The inhibitory effect of Tis A on NLRP3 
was counteracted by the NLRP3 activator nigericin and overexpression plasmid 
GV358. Tis A inhibits NLRP3 protein expression to reduce the assembly of 
NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1 inflammasome, then regulates the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling 
pathway. It regulates microglia activation and M1/M2 phenotypic polarization, 
then inhibits the production of inflammatory factors, and reduces the apoptosis 
rate of HT22 cells under inflammatory conditions, improving the survival rate of 
nerve cells to protect neurons.

OBJECTIVES: Many individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) die of 
disease-related complications, but predicting the end of life can be 
challenging. We identified a phenotype associated with approaching end of life.
METHODS: We present 4 exemplar cases where individuals with DLB experienced 
refractory psychosis before death. We reviewed codebooks and quotes from 3 
studies regarding end-of-life experiences in DLB to identify experiences that 
aligned with this phenotype.
RESULTS: In addition to the 4 cases, family caregivers in prior studies 
described prominent worsening of psychosis before death in some individuals with 
DLB. The worsening often occurred several months before death and was sometimes 
associated with rapid deterioration. Worsening psychosis was the prominent 
symptom and was not initially accompanied by cognitive or physical decline. In 
many cases, the refractory psychosis resulted in inpatient psychiatric 
hospitalization or residential care, but these scenarios were challenging 
because of the individual's behavior.
CONCLUSION: Refractory psychosis in DLB, particularly out of proportion to other 
symptoms, may be a signal of approaching the end of life. More research is 
needed to understand this phenomenon and to develop effective and safe 
treatments for psychosis in DLB.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
with rising prevalence due to the aging global population. Existing methods for 
diagnosing AD are struggling to detect the condition in its earliest and most 
treatable stages. One early indicator of AD is a substantial decrease in the 
brain's glucose metabolism. Metabolomics can detect disturbances in biofluids, 
which may be advantageous for early detection of some AD-related changes. The 
study aims to predict brain hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease using 
metabolomics findings and develop a predictive model based on metabolomic data.
METHODS: The data used in this study were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. We conducted a longitudinal study with 
three assessment time points to investigate the predictive power of baseline 
metabolomics for modeling longitudinal fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET) trajectory changes in AD patients. A total of 44 
participants with AD were included. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 
(ADAS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia 
Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were used for cognitive assessments. A single 
global brain hypo-metabolism index was used as the outcome variable.
RESULTS: Across models, we observed consistent positive relationships between 
specific cholesterol esters - CE (20:3) (p = 0.005) and CE (18:3) (p = 0.0039) - 
and FDG-PET metrics, indicating these baseline metabolites may be valuable 
indicators of future PET score changes. Selected triglycerides like DG-O 
(16:0-20:4) also showed time-specific positive associations (p = 0.017).
CONCLUSION: This research provides new insights into the disruptions in the 
metabolic network linked to AD pathology. These findings could pave the way for 
identifying novel biomarkers and potential treatment targets for AD.

INTRODUCTION: Muscarinic 1 acetylcholine receptor (M1AChR) is a member of the 
Gprotein- coupled receptor superfamily, with the dysfunction being linked to the 
onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
AIMS: Retromer complex with Vacuolar Protein Sorting-35 (VPS35) as the core 
plays an important role in the transport of biological proteins and has been 
confirmed to be closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. This study was 
designed to determine whether VPS35 could affect the trafficking mechanism of 
M1AChRs.
METHODS: The interaction between VPS35 and M1AChR was studied by 
co-immunoprecipitation method, and the recycling of M1AChR influence by VPS35 
was analyzed using biotinylation technology.
RESULTS: It was found that VPS35 affected the localization of M1AChR on the cell 
membrane by regulating intracellular M1AChR transport, thus controlling the 
M1AChR-mediated cholinergic signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: The findings presented here provide a potential pathogenesis and 
pathway for the treatment of AD.

Mashhad, Iran.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membranous particles that are 
secreted by various cell types and play a critical role in intercellular 
communication. Their unique properties and remarkable ability to deliver 
bioactive cargo to target cells have made them promising tools in the treatment 
of various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a devastating 
neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and 
neuropathological hallmarks, such as amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles. Despite extensive research, no disease-modifying therapy for AD is 
currently available. However, EVs have emerged as a potential therapeutic agent 
in AD due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, deliver bioactive 
cargo, and modulate neuroinflammation. This review provides a comprehensive 
overview of the current knowledge on the role of EVs in AD and discusses their 
potential as a therapeutic approach. It covers the mechanisms of action, 
potential therapeutic targets, and challenges and limitations of EV-based 
therapies for AD.

INTRODUCTION: Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have shown promise in reducing 
amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in neurons, but their effects in 
astrocytes, key contributors to neurodegenerative diseases, remain unclear. This 
study evaluates the efficacy of APP ASOs in astrocytes derived from an 
individual with Down syndrome (DS), a population at high risk for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from a healthy individual 
and an individual with DS were differentiated into astrocytes. Astrocytes were 
treated with APP ASOs for 10 days, and APP levels were quantified. Mitochondrial 
morphology and superoxide production in DS astrocytes were analyzed using 
super-resolution and confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: APP ASOs significantly reduced APP levels in astrocytes from both 
control and DS individuals. In DS astrocytes, treatment restored mitochondrial 
health, increasing mitochondrial number and size while reducing superoxide 
production.
DISCUSSION: APP ASOs effectively reduce APP levels and improve mitochondrial 
health in astrocytes, suggesting their potential as a therapeutic approach for 
DS and DS-related AD. Further in vivo studies are required to confirm these 
findings.
HIGHLIGHTS: APP ASOs reduce APP levels in human iPSC-derived astrocytes. APP ASO 
treatment rescues mitochondrial phenotypes in trisomy 21 astrocytes. This study 
supports ASOs as a potential therapy for Down syndrome-related Alzheimer's 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been demonstrated to have a promising effect on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. 
The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is one of the earliest brain regions affected in 
AD, and changes in its functional connectivity (FC) are reported to underlie 
disease-associated memory impairment. The aim of this study was to examine the 
effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in patients with AD.
METHODS: Demographic data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 14 AD 
patients and 14 normal controls (NCs) matched by age, sex, and educational level 
at baseline. After the baseline MRI scan, acupuncture stimulation on the 
Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) points was performed for 3 min. Then, another 
10 min of fMRI data were acquired after the needle was withdrawn. A dataset that 
included 100 healthy participants was also included to construct a reliable FC 
map of the RSC. Two sets of regions of interest (ROIs) in the RSC were selected 
to assess the sustained effect of acupuncture on FC with the RSC in AD patients 
and NCs.
RESULTS: Two sets of RSC ROI-based analyses demonstrated robust positive 
connectivity with the hippocampus (HPC). Furthermore, multiple brain regions, 
including the bilateral thalamus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), 
bilateral subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC), and right precuneus, showed decreased FC with the RSC in the AD group and 
increased FC with the RSC in the NC group after acupuncture compared to that at 
baseline. Acupuncture also specifically elicited increased FC between the RSC 
and the HPC as well as between the RSC and the parahippocampal gyrus in AD 
patients and decreased FC between the RSC and the visual cortices in NCs. 
Additionally, diminished FC with the RSC was correlated with neuropsychological 
scale scores in the AD group before acupuncture treatment.
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm and extend previous studies suggesting that 
acupuncture at Taichong (LIV3) and Hegu (LI4) can exert bidirectional and benign 
regulatory effects on RSC connectivity in AD patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, 
accounting for approximately 70% of dementia cases worldwide. Patients gradually 
exhibit cognitive decline, such as memory loss, aphasia, and changes in 
personality and behavior. Research has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction 
plays a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Mitochondrial 
dysfunction primarily leads to increased oxidative stress, imbalances in 
mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitophagy, and mitochondrial genome 
abnormalities. These mitochondrial abnormalities are closely associated with 
amyloid-beta and tau protein pathology, collectively accelerating the 
neurodegenerative process. This review summarizes the role of mitochondria in 
the development of AD, the latest research progress, and explores the potential 
of mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies for AD. Targeting 
mitochondria-related pathways may significantly improve the quality of life for 
AD patients in the future.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (sTREM1) are elevated 
in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the relationship between 
CSF sTREM1 and hippocampal atrophy remains to be elucidated. The primary aim of 
this study was to investigate the association between CSF sTREM1 levels and 
longitudinal changes in hippocampal volumes, and to determine if this 
relationship is moderated by cognitive status.
METHODS: We included 576 participants, comprising 152 cognitively unimpaired 
(CU) and 424 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals. In the cross-sectional 
analyses, Pearson's correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationship 
between baseline CSF sTREM1 levels and hippocampal volumes in both CU and CI 
participants. For the longitudinal analyses, a linear mixed-effects model was 
employed to assess the significance of the three-way interaction between CSF 
sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up time on adjusted hippocampal 
volume (aHV). Further stratified analyses based on cognitive status were 
performed to dissect the specific effects within each group.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed significantly elevated baseline CSF sTREM1 levels 
in CI participants compared to CU participants. Cross-sectional analyses 
demonstrated that CSF sTREM1 levels were negatively associated with hippocampal 
volumes in both CU and CI participants. In the longitudinal analyses, the 
three-way interaction between CSF sTREM1 levels, cognitive status, and follow-up 
time was found to be significant for aHV. Stratified analyses indicated that, in 
CI participants, higher CSF sTREM1 levels were associated with a more 
accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy, whereas no such association was 
observed in CU participants.
CONCLUSION: These results underscore the complex interplay between 
neuroinflammation, as reflected by CSF sTREM1 levels, hippocampal atrophy, and 
cognitive decline. The data suggest that neuroinflammation may contribute 
differently to hippocampal atrophy rates in CI versus CU individuals, 
highlighting the potential for targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in the 
prevention and treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare and recently described 
neuroinflammatory disease associated with specific autoantibodies. 
Anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1) encephalitis is a rare but 
treatable type of AE discovered in recent years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a 
degenerative brain disease and the most common cause of dementia. AD may undergo 
a series of pathological physiological changes in brain tissue 20 years before 
the onset of typical symptoms. The stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that 
occurs during this process, known as MCI due to AD, is the earliest stage with 
clinical symptoms. MCI is typically categorized into two subtypes: Amnestic MCI 
(aMCI) and non-aMCI.
CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a patient with rapid cognitive impairment, 
diagnosed with anti-LGI1 antibody-mediated AE and aMCI, and treated at Peking 
University Shenzhen Hospital in March 2023. The patient was hospitalized with 
acute memory decline for more than 3 months. Both the cerebrospinal fluid and 
serum were positive for anti-LGI1 antibodies, biomarkers of AD coexisting in the 
patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Following combination treatment with 
immunoglobulin therapy and glucocorticoid, plus inhibition of 
acetylcholinesterase, the patient's cognitive function significantly improved. 
Throughout the 3-month follow-up period, a sustained improvement in cognitive 
function was observed. The results of serum anti-LGI1 antibody were negative.
CONCLUSION: This case has raised awareness of the possible interaction between 
AE and early AD (including MCI due to AD), and alerted clinicians to the 
possibility of concurrent rare and common diseases in patients presenting with 
cognitive impairment.

Reminiscence is a meaningful activity for people with dementia, but research 
implementing digital reminiscence tools into environments with older people is 
not well developed. This project sought to understand the effectiveness of a 
digital reminiscence tool in aiding person-centred dementia care with people 
attending a day respite centre and a group residential home, in metropolitan 
eastern Australia. This study used semi-structured interviews and ethnographic 
observations using a qualitative reflexive thematic analysis with seventeen 
participants including people with dementia (n = 8), their loved ones (n = 5) 
and staff n = 4) Themes identified were: 1. Remembering myself; 2. Reminiscing 
the person before and with dementia; 3. Enhanced relationships through 
self-expression; 4. Person-centred adaptation and the art of the interview; and 
5. Future potential. Findings indicate that the StoryTiling app was 
user-friendly, supported reminiscence activities and enhanced person-centred 
care. The reminiscence activity enhanced relationships between participants, 
families, and carers, facilitating a deeper knowing of the person with dementia. 
The activities supported positive memories and emotions and helped reinforce the 
identity of the person with dementia in both their own mind, and their loved 
ones. The information captured in the StoryTiling process enabled person-centred 
care in improving the ability to know a person and being able to relate and 
respond to their individual needs, wants and goals. The process was dependent on 
the 'art of the question' and the 'art of the interview', particularly by people 
who know the person with dementia and are trauma-informed in order to 
effectively progress interviews and utilise them within the care environment. 
Enabling nudge activities that promote person-centred engagement such as 
reminiscence through digital storytelling may help foster person-centred care in 
the aged care sector.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that is 
marked by profound neurovascular dysfunction and significant cell-specific 
alterations in the brain vasculature. Recent advances in high throughput 
single-cell transcriptomics technology have enabled the study of the human brain 
vasculature at an unprecedented depth. Additionally, the understudied niche of 
cerebrovascular cells, such as endothelial and mural cells, and their subtypes 
have been scrutinized for understanding cellular and transcriptional 
heterogeneity in AD. Here, we provide an overview of rich transcriptional 
signatures derived from recent single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic 
studies of human brain vascular cells and their implications for targeted 
therapy for AD. We conducted an in-depth literature search using Medline and 
Covidence to identify pertinent AD studies that utilized single-cell 
technologies in human post-mortem brain tissue by focusing on understanding the 
transcriptional differences in cerebrovascular cell types and subtypes in AD and 
cognitively normal older adults. We also discuss impaired cellular crosstalk 
between vascular cells and neuroglial units, as well as astrocytes in AD. 
Additionally, we contextualize the findings from single-cell studies of distinct 
endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes in the human 
AD brain and highlight pathways for potential therapeutic interventions as a 
concerted multi-omic effort with spatial transcriptomics technology, 
neuroimaging, and neuropathology. Overall, we provide a detailed account of the 
vascular cell-specific transcriptional signatures in AD and their crucial 
cellular crosstalk with the neuroglial unit.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prominent neurodegenerative disorder affecting the 
central nervous system in the elderly. Current understanding of AD primarily 
centers on the gradual decline in cognitive and memory functions, believed to be 
influenced by factors including mitochondrial dysfunction, β-amyloid 
aggregation, and neuroinflammation. Emerging research indicates that 
neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the development of AD, with the 
inflammasome potentially mediating inflammatory responses that contribute to 
neurodegeneration. Recent studies in AD pathology have identified a novel form 
of inflammasome referred to as NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 
(NLRP3) inflammasome. Pathological alterations closely associated with NLRP3 
inflammasome activation have been observed in the brain tissues of AD patients, 
transgenic mice, and in vitro neurocyte models. Numerous studies have 
demonstrated the potent neuroprotective properties of natural plant products 
(NPPs) against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated AD pathology. This review provides a 
comprehensive examination of the NLRP3 inflammasome, its involvement in AD 
pathology, and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of NPP 
targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Blood-brain barrier opening with ultrasound can potentiate drug efficacy in the 
treatment of brain pathologies and also provides therapeutic effects on its own. 
It is an innovative tool to transiently, repeatedly and safely open the barrier, 
with studies showing beneficial effects in both preclinical models for 
Alzheimer's disease and recent clinical studies. The first preclinical and 
clinical work has mainly shown a decrease in amyloid burden in mice models and 
in patients. However, Alzheimer's disease pathology also encompasses tauopathy, 
which is closely related to cognitive decline, making it a crucial therapeutic 
target. The effects of blood-brain barrier opening with ultrasound have been 
rarely assessed on tau and are still unclear.
METHODS: This systematic review, conducted through searches using Pubmed, 
Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central databases, extracted results of 15 
studies reporting effects of blood-brain barrier opening using ultrasound on tau 
proteins.
RESULTS: This review of the literature indicates that blood-brain barrier 
opening using ultrasound can decrease the extent of the tau pathology or 
potentialize the effect of a therapeutic drug. However, selected studies report 
paradoxically that blood-brain barrier opening can increase tau pathology burden 
and induce brain damage.
DISCUSSION: Apparent discrepancies between reports could originate from the 
variability in protocols or analytical methods that may impact the effects of 
blood-brain barrier opening with ultrasound on tauopathies, glial populations, 
tissue integrity and functional outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This calls for a better standardization effort combined with 
improved methodologies allowing between-studies comparisons, and for further 
understanding of the effects of blood-brain barrier opening on tau pathology as 
an essential prerequisite before translation to clinic.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common central neurodegenerative 
disease in the world after Alzheimer's disease (AD), which mainly occurs in 
middle-aged and elderly people, and is increasing with the aging of the 
population. With the increasing incidence of PD, it is particularly important to 
explore its pathology and provide effective interventions and treatments. The 
pathogenesis of PD involves a variety of factors such as genetics, environment, 
and age, and is not yet fully understood. The main pathogenic mechanisms include 
neuronal degeneration, abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein, formation of Lewy 
bodies and oxidative stress, etc. In recent years, gene therapy, stem cell 
therapy, and immunotherapy, along with traditional drugs and surgical 
treatments, have become widely used. Currently, all treatments for PD are 
symptomatic and there is no radical cure. This paper reviews existing 
traditional and emerging treatments for PD to provide a theoretical basis for 
the in-depth study of PD pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Meanwhile, the 
application of gene editing and delivery, stem cell transplantation, 
immunotherapy and multi-target therapy laid the foundation for the development 
of safer, more effective and more comprehensive treatments for PD.

Tau hyper-phosphorylation has been recognized as an essential contributor to 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. In the 
last decade, tau hyper-phosphorylation has gained considerable concern in AD 
therapeutic development. Tauopathies are manifested with a broad spectrum of 
symptoms, from dementia to cognitive decline and motor impairments. Tau 
undergoes conformational changes and abnormal phosphorylation that mediate its 
detaching from microtubules, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In the 
current study, a widely used P301S transgenic mice model of tauopathy was 
employed to evaluate the possible neuroprotective effects of semaglutide as an 
autophagy regulator through modifications of the brain renin-angiotensin system 
(RAS). Mice were divided into two groups according to their genotypes (wild type 
(Wt) and P301S), which were further subdivided to receive either vehicle 
(saline) or semaglutide (25 nmol/kg, i. p.), once every 2 days for 28 days. 
Current data suggest that semaglutide ameliorated the hyperactive pattern and 
alleviated the cognitive decline of P301S mice. It also hastened the autophagic 
flux through augmenting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/sirtuin 1/forkhead box 
protein O1 signaling. Semaglutide also hindered the expression of phosphorylated 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and phosphorylated glycogen 
synthase kinase-3 beta at serine 9, reducing the propagation of 
neuroinflammatory cytokines and oxidative reactions. Finally, semaglutide 
protected against hippocampal degeneration and reduced the immunoreactivity for 
total tau and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule. Semaglutide showed 
promising neuroprotective implications in alleviating tauopathy-related AD's 
molecular and behavioral deficits through controlling autophagy and brain RAS.

The development of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease 
remains challenging due to the complex pathology and the presence of the 
blood-brain barrier. Previously we have described the investigation of a 
brain-penetrating multifunctional bioreactive nanoparticle system capable of 
remodeling the hypoxic and inflammatory brain microenvironment and reducing 
beta-amyloid plaques improving cognitive function in a mouse model of 
Alzheimer's disease. Despite the linkage of hypoxia and inflammation to 
metabolic alteration, the effects of this system on modulating cerebral glucose 
metabolism, mitochondrial activity and synaptic function remained to be 
elucidated. To examine this, a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease 
(TgCRND8) in vivo were treated intravenously with beta-amyloid 
antibody-conjugated (Ab), blood-brain barrier-crossing terpolymer (TP) 
containing polymer-lipid based manganese dioxide nanoparticles (Ab-TP-MDNPs). 
Alterations in cerebral glucose utilization were determined by [1⁸F]FDG-PET 
imaging in vivo, with glucose metabolism and mitochondrial activity analyzed by 
biomarkers and studies with primary neurons in vitro. Synaptic function was 
evaluated by both biomarkers and electrophysiologic analysis. Current study 
shows that intravenously administered Ab-TP-MDNPs enhanced cerebral glucose 
utilization, improved glucose metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and increased 
the levels of neprilysin, O-glycosylation. The consequence of this was enhanced 
glucose and ATP availability, resulting in improved long-term potentiation for 
promoting neuronal synaptic function. This study highlights the importance of 
targeting the metabolism of complex disease pathologies in addressing 
disease-modifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease.

Background: Dementia clinical trials often fail to include diverse and 
historically minoritized groups. Objective: We sought to adapt the Alzheimer's 
Disease and Related Dementias-Palliative Care (ADRD-PC) clinical trial to 
improve enrollment and address the cultural needs of people with late-stage ADRD 
who identify as Hispanic or Latino and their family caregivers. Design: 
Bilingual, bicultural research team members adapted study materials and 
processes using the Cultural Adaptation Process Model. Investigators and 
research staff held three meetings with eight Hispanic/Latino advisors-seven 
dementia caregivers and one health care professional. The first two meetings 
informed linguistic and cultural adaptation of study materials and processes. 
After piloting the adapted materials with Hispanic/Latino patient-caregiver 
dyads in the ADRD-PC study, the third meeting focused on refining protocols for 
recruitment. Results: Key reflections from advisor meetings guided cultural 
adaptation: lived experiences on dementia caregiving; patient, caregiver, and 
clinician interactions in the health care system; and limited knowledge and 
misconceptions of palliative care. Adaptations to the ADRD-PC study materials 
included specific consideration of preferred language, word choices (i.e., 
"palliative care" and "caregiver"), and recruitment considerations related to 
potential barriers to palliative care or research in general. Conclusions: 
Cultural adaptation of the ADRD-PC dementia palliative care clinical trial 
protocol depended on participatory methods and collaboration between 
Hispanic/Latino caregiver advisors and researchers, including bilingual, 
bicultural team members. Comparable methods may inform future culturally 
inclusive approaches to clinical research and thus improve representation of 
minoritized groups in dementia care research.

BACKGROUND: Despite transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has 
demonstrated encouraging potential for modulating the circadian rhythm, little 
is known about how well and sustainably tDCS might improve the subjective sleep 
quality in older adults. This study sought to determine how tDCS affected sleep 
quality and cognition, as well as how well pre-treatment sleep quality predicted 
tDCS effects on domain-specific cognitive functions in patients with mild 
neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease (NCD-AD).
METHODS: This clinical trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of tDCS and 
cognitive training in mild NCD-AD patients (n =  201). Over the course of four 
weeks, patients were randomized to receive either tDCS plus working memory 
training, or sham tDCS plus working memory training, or tDCS plus controlled 
cognitive training. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to 
measured subjective sleep quality. The Alzheimer's disease assessment 
scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) was used to evaluate domain-specific 
cognitive functions.
RESULTS: Recurrent tDCS treatments enhanced subjective sleep quality and 
cognition considerably. The poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI >  5) who received tDCS 
treatment had more cognitive benefits (p =  0.031, Cohen's d =  0.605) and sleep 
improvements (p <  0.001, Cohen's d =  1.209) in comparison to cognitive 
training. Pre-treatment subjective sleep quality was linked to tDCS-induced 
improvement in memory function.
CONCLUSION: During the course of two months, repeated tDCS could considerably 
enhance subjective sleep quality. For the cognitive benefits of the treatments, 
the status of pre-treatment subjective sleep quality is crucial. More thorough 
research is necessary to explore an efficient approach to managing comorbidities 
for preclinical AD patients.

The concise synthesis of O-methyl-d-inositol derivative and conduritol 
derivatives was obtained starting from p-benzoquinone. Spectroscopic methods 
have been performed for the characterization of newly synthesized compounds. 
Cyclitols are useful molecules with anticancer, antibiotic, antinutrient, and 
antileukemic activities. Inositol class molecules, known as the most important 
cyclitol derivatives, were examined in this study for their 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide radical scavenging and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and glycosidase inhibition activities. It was 
observed that compound 5, in particular, showed efficacy that competed with the 
standards in terms of both antioxidant activity and enzyme inhibitor potential. 
Additionally, compound 5 shows effective antimicrobial activity. The 
water-soluble characteristics and lipophilic properties of the compounds were 
also considered and discussed. Moreover, the quantum chemical analyses were 
performed in light of the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G** level computations to 
elucidate/compare the studied inositols' possible reactivity directions. 
Additionally, the interactions of the molecules were analyzed against 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), peroxiredoxin 5, and DNA gyrase by molecular 
docking methods. Cholinesterase inhibitors have an important status as the most 
important drug group used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease today. 
Considering the effects of inhibition of the α-glucosidase enzyme by inhibitors, 
such molecules can also be used as therapeutic components in the treatment of 
diabetes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disorder defined by the 
formation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles within the 
brain. Current pharmacological treatments for AD only provide symptomatic 
relief, and there is a lack of definitive disease-modifying therapies. Chemical 
chaperones, such as 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4PBA) and Tauroursodeoxycholic acid, 
have shown neuroprotective effects in animal and cell culture models. However, 
their therapeutic application is limited due to low bioavailability and poor 
ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The study aims to design and identify 
novel derivatives of 4PBA analogs & bile acids using computational molecular 
docking, ADME/pharmacokinetic predictions, and molecular dynamic (MD) 
simulations to develop potential anti-aggregation compounds targeting Aβ, a key 
player in AD pathology. A comprehensive library of 25,802 derivatives was 
created using 3PPA, 3MPP, 5PVA, IPA, and bile acid scaffolds, which were 
examined for their pharmacokinetic characteristics and binding affinities with 
the Aβ protein. Molecular docking and ADME predictions revealed IPA-1 and DCA-1 
as leading candidates due to their robust binding interactions with the Aβ 
protein, along with minimal toxicity, high solubility, and good absorption 
profiles. Further, MD analysis over an extended period at 100 ns confirmed the 
better stability of IPA-1 and DCA-1 during interaction with the protein. These 
findings highlight promising drug candidates, necessitating further validation 
through cell and animal studies.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible age-related 
neurodegenerative condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) 
peptides and neurofibrillary tangles. Di Huang Yi Zhi (DHYZ) formula, a 
traditional Chinese herbal compound comprising several prescriptions, 
demonstrates properties that improve cognitive abilities in clinical. 
Nonetheless, its molecular mechanisms on treating AD through improving neuron 
cells mitochondria function have not been deeply investigated.
OBJECTIVE: This study administered DHYZ to APP/PS1 mice to explore its potential 
therapeutic mechanisms in AD treatment.
METHODS: APP/PS1 transgenic mice were given DHYZ (L, M, H), donepezil, or 
distilled water for a consecutive 12-week period. The Morris water maze test was 
used to assess memory capacity, transmission electron microscopy was used to 
observe mitochondrial and synaptic structures, immunohistochemistry and western 
blot detected proteins involved in the mitochondrial autophagy pathway, ELISA 
measured serum Aβ content, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 
dUTP nick end labeling assessed neuronal cell apoptosis.
RESULTS: DHYZ demonstrates a notable therapeutic impact on mice with AD, 
effectively improving cognitive and memory impairments. DHYZ decreases Aβ 
accumulation in the hippocampus by reducing BACE1 activity and enhancing Aβ 
clearance through the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, DHYZ significantly 
suppresses neuronal apoptosis, enhances synaptic structure, and increases 
synapse numbers, processes strongly linked to the activation of mitochondrial 
PINK1-Parkin autophagy.
CONCLUSIONS: DHYZ enhances cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice by stimulating 
neuronal mitochondrial autophagy through the PINK1-Parkin pathway.

The spontaneous aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) leads to neuronal cell death in 
the brain and causes the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The efficient 
detection of the aggregation state of Aβ holds significant promise for the early 
diagnosis and subsequent treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder. 
Currently, most of the fluorescent probes used for the detection of Aβ fibrils 
share similar recognition moieties, such as the N,N-dimethylamino group, 
N,N-diethylamino group, and piperidyl group. The development of fluorescent 
probes incorporating novel recognition groups will, in principle, bring new 
properties for the detection and imaging of Aβ aggregates. Herein, we designed 
and synthesized three fluorescent probes (1 CarbCN, 2 NTCN, and 3 NCarbCN) based 
on dicyanoisophorone. The probe 3 NCarbCN, which integrated two recognition 
moieties, a carbamate unit (a new recognition group) together with a 
N,N-dimethylamino group, showed a sensitive turn-on fluorescence response toward 
the early aggregation state of Aβ, along with a high binding affinity (Kd = 59 
nM) and recognition selectivity for Aβ fibrils. Theoretical calculations 
revealed that the carbamate unit of 3 NCarbCN could provide an additional three 
hydrogen bonding interaction with Aβ42 fibrils. Furthermore, the probe 3 NCarbCN 
efficiently crossed the blood-brain barrier and exhibited a higher response in 
the brains of AD model mice. Co-staining of isolated brain sections with 
monoclonal antibody further demonstrated specific binding of 3 NCarbCN to Aβ 
plaques in the brains of AD model mice, thus demonstrating its great potential 
for the early diagnosis of such neurodegenerative disorders.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most complex neurological disorders and 
millions of people are suffering from this disease all over the world. In the 
past two decades acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been the most explored 
pathological hallmark. The generation of potent AChE inhibitors has grown as a 
rapid pathological tool for the efficacious treatment of the disease. Hence, 
AChE enzyme is extensively explored as a drug discovery tool for the development 
of potent therapeutics. We have used chromone derivatives with known biological 
activities for developing a Gaussian field-based 3D QSAR pharmacophore model 
using PHASE module of Schrodinger with statistically significant R2 and Q2 
values of 0.92 and 0.9209, respectively. ChEMBL and MCULE databases were 
screened using the best pharmacophore hypothesis model (AAHHRR_4) with features 
of two hydrogen bond acceptors (A1, A2), two hydrophobic regions (H1, H2), and 
two aromatic regions (R1, R2). These were subjected to structure-based virtual 
screening using extra precision, MM/GBSA and ADME calculations for calculating 
the binding free energies and pharmacokinetic properties, respectively. 
Subsequently, two hit molecules i.e. CHEMBL1319989 and MCULE-2246633290 were 
identified. The leads exhibited higher docking score (-8.859 and 
-9.984 kcal/mol) and ΔGbinding (-57.63 and -56.45 kcal/mol) as compared to the 
reference (ΔGbinding= -53.79 kcal/mol). MD simulation study exhibited stable 
interactions with the binding free energy (ΔGMMPBSA) of -27.29 and 
-21.26 kcal/mol for CHEMBL1319989 and MCULE-2246633290, respectively. So, the 
generated pharmacophore model may be considered as a valuable tool for the 
development of potent AChE inhibitors for the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Chronic periodontitis and tooth loss contribute to cognitive 
decline. Since many biological processes are shared by loss of teeth and loss of 
pulps, this study investigated the potential association between loss of pulp 
and the development of dementia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to 
investigate the association between dental treatment and the development of 
dementia. The records of dental treatment during the 10 years prior to the first 
diagnosis of dementia were extracted from the Elderly Cohort Database of the 
National Health Information Sharing Service of Korea. The independence of 
dementia compared to the number of pulps or teeth removed was evaluated using 
the chi-squared test. The subjects were grouped by the number of teeth or pulps 
treated, and their odds ratio for dementia was calculated.
RESULTS: Analysis of 591,592 sessions for pulpectomy and 710,722 sessions for 
tooth extraction from 558,147 individuals revealed a significant association 
with Alzheimer's dementia, but not with vascular or unspecified dementia. The 
number of dementia patients based on the number of pulps or teeth extracted were 
significantly different across age groups. The odds ratios demonstrated a 
tendency to increase with the number of dental treatments and decrease with age 
at the time of diagnosis of dementia. The number of pulps removed to achieve a 
notable impact on Alzheimer's dementia was found to be lower than the number of 
teeth extracted.
CONCLUSION: The loss of pulp increased incidence of Alzheimer's dementia, with 
the impact being more pronounced in younger geriatric groups.

INTRODUCTION: Intranasal (IN) deferoxamine (DFO) has emerged over the past 
decade as a promising therapeutic in preclinical experiments across 
neurodegenerative and neurovascular diseases. As an antioxidant iron chelator, 
its mechanisms are multimodal, involving the binding of brain iron and the 
consequent engagement of several pathways to counter pathogenesis across 
multiple diseases. We and other research groups have shown that IN DFO rescues 
cognitive impairment in several rodent models of Alzheimer Disease (AD).
METHODS: This study was designed to probe dosing regimens to inform future 
clinical trials, while exploring mechanisms within the intracerebroventricular 
(ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) model.
RESULTS: Five weeks of daily IN dosing of Long Evans rats with 15 μL of a 1% 
(0.3 mg), but not 0.1% (0.03 mg), solution of DFO rescued cognitive impairment 
caused by ICV STZ administration as assessed with the Morris Water Maze (MWM) 
test of spatial memory and learning. Furthermore, IN DFO modulated several 
aspects of the neuroinflammatory milieu of the ICV STZ model, which was assessed 
through a novel panel of brain cytokines and immunohistochemistry. Using 
RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis, STZ was shown to induce several pathways of 
cell death and neuroinflammation, and IN DFO engaged multiple transcriptomic 
pathways involved in hippocampal neuronal survival.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this study is the first to assess the 
transcriptomic pathways and mechanisms associated with either the ICV STZ model 
or DFO treatment, and the first to demonstrate efficacy at this low dose.

The advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology in recent decades has 
led to a greater understanding of the components of the oral microbiota, 
providing a solid foundation for extensive research in this field. The oral 
microbiota plays an important role in an individual's overall health. It has 
been shown to be significantly correlated with chronic human diseases, including 
diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, periodontal disease, and 
Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, tumor occurrence and development are closely 
related to the oral microbiome. Specific bacteria, such as Fusobacterium 
nucleatum (F. nucleatum), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), 
Streptococcus, Streptomyces, Prevotella, and Fibrophagy gingivalis, play 
critical roles in cancer development. The oral microbiota has various oncogenic 
mechanisms, including bacterial inflammation, immunological suppression, tumor 
growth mediated by bacterial toxins, antiapoptotic activity, and carcinogenic 
effects. This paper reviews the role of the oral microbiota in the occurrence 
and progression of cancer and systematically elucidates the molecular mechanisms 
by which dysbiosis influences tumorigenesis and tumor progression. This 
information can provide a theoretical basis for exploring cancer treatment 
strategies and offer new insights for cancer prevention.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are a family of ligand-gated ion 
channels expressed in nervous and non-nervous system tissue important for 
memory, movement, and sensory processes. The pharmacological targeting of 
nAChRs, using small molecules or peptides, is a promising approach for the 
development of compounds for the treatment of various human diseases including 
inflammatory and neurogenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Using 
the Aplysia californica acetylcholine binding protein (Ac-AChBP) as an 
established structural surrogate for human homopentameric α7 nAChRs, we describe 
an innovative protein painting mass spectrometry (MS) method that can be used to 
identify interaction sites for various ligands at the extracellular nAChR site. 
We describe how the use of small molecule dyes can be optimized to uncover 
contact sites for ligand-protein interactions based on MS detection. Protein 
painting MS has been recently shown to be an effective tool for the 
identification of residues within Ac-AChBP involved in the binding of know 
ligands such as α-bungarotoxin. This strategy can be used with computational 
structural modeling to identify binding regions involved in drug targeting at 
the nAChR. Key features • Identify binding ligands of nicotinic receptors based 
on similarity with the acetylcholine binding protein. • Can be adapted to test 
various ligands and binding conditions. • Mass spectrometry identification of 
specific amino acid residues that contribute to protein binding. • Can be 
effectively coupled to structural modeling analysis.

INTRODUCTION: This research is focused on early detection of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) using a multiscale feature fusion framework, combining biomarkers from 
memory, vision, and speech regions extracted from magnetic resonance imaging and 
positron emission tomography images.
METHODS: Using 2D gray level co-occurrence matrix (2D-GLCM) texture features, 
volume, standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR), and obesity from different 
neuroimaging modalities, the study applies various classifiers, demonstrating a 
feature importance analysis in each region of interest. The research employs 
four classifiers, namely linear support vector machine, linear discriminant 
analysis, logistic regression (LR), and logistic regression with stochastic 
gradient descent (LRSGD) classifiers, to determine feature importance, leading 
to subsequent validation using a probabilistic neural network classifier.
RESULTS: The research highlights the critical role of brain texture features, 
particularly in memory regions, for AD detection. Significant sex-specific 
differences are observed, with males showing significance in texture features in 
memory regions, volume in vision regions, and SUVR in speech regions, while 
females exhibit significance in texture features in memory and speech regions, 
and SUVR in vision regions. Additionally, the study analyzes how obesity affects 
features used in AD prediction models, clarifying its effects on speech and 
vision regions, particularly brain volume.
CONCLUSION: The findings contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of 
feature fusion, sex-specific differences, and the impact of obesity on 
AD-related biomarkers, paving the way for future research in early AD detection 
strategies and cognitive impairment classification.

Human microbiomes are microbial populations that form a symbiotic relationship 
with humans. There are up to 1000 species on the surface of human skin and 
mucosal system, among which gut microbiota attracts the most interest. As the 
beginning of the digestive tract, oral cavity is also an important microbial 
habitat in the human body which is the first line of defense against pathogens 
entering the body. Many studies have revealed that oral microbial dysbiosis 
could not only contribute to oral diseases but also whole-body systemic diseases 
and health status. Oral microorganisms can enter the gastrointestinal tract with 
saliva and food, or enter the blood circulation through mouth breakage, thus 
causing systemic inflammation and aging-related diseases including some causal 
links to Alzheimer's disease. A series of changes take place in oral microbial 
composition during development, with different age stages marked by different 
dominant microbial species. Despite a lack of comprehensive studies on aging 
oral microbiota, through systemic inflammation, oral pathogenic microbes are 
likely to contribute inflammatory aging. As inflammaging is a key signature and 
one of the causes for accelerated aging, improving the structure of oral 
microbiome may be not only a new strategy for disease prevention and treatment, 
but also for aging intervention.

BackgroundLittle is known about the utilization of outpatient support services 
by people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).ObjectiveThis study aimed to 
analyze the use of support services by people with MCI compared to people with 
mild to moderate dementia.MethodsThe data basis is the multicenter, prospective 
register study 'Digital Dementia Register Bavaria - digiDEM Bayern'. The sample 
consists of 913 people with cognitive impairment, including 389 with MCI and 524 
with mild to moderate dementia. Classification into 'MCI' and 'mild to moderate 
dementia' is based on the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment. The use of support services was surveyed using the Dementia 
Assessment of Service Needs. Fisher's exact test and multiple linear regression 
were conducted to analyze for group differences.ResultsFour out of thirteen 
support services are used less frequently by people with MCI than by people with 
mild to moderate dementia: 'Outpatient care' (p < 0.001, φ = -0.199), 
'Acquisition of aids' (p = 0.004, φ = -0.096), 'Adult daycare' (p < 0.001, 
φ = -0.290), and 'Respite care' (p = 0.029, φ = -0.095). Even the overall 
utilization rate is lower for people with MCI (b = -0.18, p = 0.027), although 
other factors such as a care level (b = 1.01, p < 0.001) are more strongly 
related.ConclusionsThere are differences in utilization between people with MCI 
and people with mild to moderate dementia, but these are small. Therefore, 
access to support services should be provided at the first signs of cognitive 
impairment.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by almost all cell types and contain 
DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids and other metabolites. EVs were initially believed to 
be cellular waste but now recognized for their role in cell-to-cell 
communication. Later, EVs from immune cells were discovered to function 
similarly to their parent cells, paving the way for their use as gene and drug 
carriers. EVs from different cell types or biological fluids carry distinct 
cargo depending on their origin, and they perform diverse functions. For 
instance, EVs derived from stem cells possess pluripotent properties, reflecting 
the cargo from their parent cells. Over the past two decades, substantial 
preclinical and clinical research has explored EVs-mediated drug and gene 
delivery to various organs, including the brain. Natural or intrinsic EVs may be 
effective for certain applications, but as drug or gene carriers, they 
demonstrate broader and more efficient potential across various diseases. Here, 
we review research on using EVs to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases, 
such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson diseases, depression, anxiety, dementia, 
and acute ischemic strokes. We first reviewed the naïve EVs, especially 
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived EVs in CNS diseases and summarized the 
clinical trials of EVs in treating CNS diseases and highlighted the reports of 
two complete trials. Then, we overviewed the preclinical research of EVs as drug 
and gene delivery vehicles in CNS disease models, including the most recent two 
years' progress and discussed the mechanisms and new methods of engineered EVs 
for targeting CNS. Finally, we discussed challenges and future directions and of 
EVs as personalized medicine for CNS diseases.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that increased 
activation of aspartic endopeptidases (AEPs) is a common symptom in 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). AEP cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP), 
tau (microtubule-associated protein tau), α- synuclein (α-syn), SET (a 39-KDa 
phosphoprotein widely expressed in various tissues and localizes predominantly 
in the nucleus), and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and promotes their 
aggregation, contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) pathogenesis. Abundant evidence 
supports the notion that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ)/AEP may play 
an important role in NDDs. Developing its small molecule inhibitors is a 
promising treatment of NDDs. However, current research suggests that the 
pathophysiological mechanism of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway is very complex in NDDs. 
This review summarizes the structure of C/EBPβ and AEP, their major 
physiological functions, potential pathogenesis, their small molecule 
inhibitors, and how C/EBPβ/AEP offers a novel pathway for the treatment of NDDs.

The three-dimensional structure of proteins, achieved through the folding of the 
nascent polypeptide chain in vivo, is largely facilitated by molecular 
chaperones, which are crucial for determining protein functionality. In addition 
to aiding in the folding process, chaperones target misfolded proteins for 
degradation, acting as a quality control system within the cell. Defective 
protein folding has been implicated in a wide range of clinical conditions, 
including neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. It is now well understood 
that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, 
Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease shares a common mechanism: the accumulation of 
misfolded proteins, which aggregate and become toxic to cells. Among the family 
of molecular chaperones, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are highly expressed in 
response to cellular stress and play a pivotal role in preventing protein 
aggregation. Specific chaperones, particularly HSPs, are now recognized as 
critical in halting the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in 
these conditions. Consequently, these chaperones are increasingly considered 
promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of protein 
aggregation-related diseases. This review highlights research exploring the 
potential roles of specific molecular chaperones in disorders characterized by 
the accumulation of misfolded proteins.

Contradictory results for the association between metformin intake and changes 
in cognitive function have been reported. We attempted to overview systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses showing the role of metformin, as mono or combination 
therapy, in cognitive performance alterations among patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to determine the quality of the evidence as well. 
To find the English-written reviews, a literature search was conducted on 
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Trip, and Google Scholar by 
May 1, 2023. The literature search unearthed 2672 records, 10 of which were 
included in the study. Metformin may provide cognitive benefits for patients 
with type 2 diabetes, as evidence suggests potential improvements in memory and 
a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Even though the Alzheimer's 
Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) score alterations 
correspond to raising concerns about cognitive decline, Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) and selective reminding test (SRT) score improvements support 
metformin's role in improving specific cognitive domains. As such, metformin may 
exert differential impacts on various aspects of cognitive performance in these 
patients. However, the inconsistency and low quality of current evidence point 
toward the need for accurate research to elucidate whether metformin's cognitive 
effects are protective, neutral, or context-dependent based on patient profiles.
