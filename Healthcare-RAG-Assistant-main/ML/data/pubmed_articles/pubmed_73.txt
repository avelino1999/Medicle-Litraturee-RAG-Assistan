Sarcopenia and AD are both classic degenerative diseases, and there is growing 
epidemiological evidence of their comorbidity with aging; however, the 
mechanisms underlying the biology of their commonality have not yet been 
thoroughly investigated. APP is a membrane protein that is expressed in tissues 
and is expressed not only in the nervous system but also in the NMJ and muscle. 
Deposition of its proteolytic cleavage product, Aβ, has been described as a 
central component of AD pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that excessive 
accumulation and aberrant expression of APP in muscle lead to pathological 
muscle lesions, but the pathogenic mechanism by which APP and its proteolytic 
cleavage products act in skeletal muscle is less well understood. By summarizing 
and analyzing the literature concerning the role, pathogenicity and pathological 
mechanisms of APP and its cleavage products in the nervous system and muscles, 
we aimed to explore the intrinsic pathological mechanisms of myocerebral 
comorbidities and to provide new perspectives and theoretical foundations for 
the prevention and treatment of AD and sarcopenia comorbidities.

Insomnia has now become a major health problem of global concern, with about 1/3 
of the population suffering from sleep problems, a proportion that is still 
rising year by year. Most of the therapeutic drugs for insomnia currently used 
in clinical practice are not developed in a targeted manner, but are discovered 
by chance, and have unavoidable side effects such as addiction. Finding a safer 
and more effective therapeutic drug has become an urgent need for current 
research. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory 
neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It can ameliorate Insomnia, 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Epilepsy, and other neurological 
disorders. Various mechanisms have been reported for GABA to ameliorate 
insomnia, such as GABAA receptor modulation, GABAB receptor modulation, 
inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses, repair of oxidative damage, and 
inter-regulation of the circadian rhythm hormone melatonin. GABA is a potential 
therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of insomnia. This paper 
reviews mechanisms of GABA and its receptors in insomnia diseases and the 
potential of GABA analogs application and discusses the research progress of 
GABA as a promising therapeutic drug for insomnia diseases. This will help the 
development of novel targeted GABA-like drugs and provide new ideas and methods 
for the clinical treatment of insomnia.

The growing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease calls for a drug that can 
simultaneously act towards several targets involved in the pathophysiology of 
the disease. In our study, we evaluated the potential of hydrazone and 
N-acylhydrazone derivatives of vitamin B6 and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde to be used 
as multi-target directed ligands targeting cholinergic system by inhibiting 
acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase, lowering the accumulation of β-amyloid 
plaques by inhibiting both the β-secretase activity and amyloid 
self-aggregation, and maintaining the biometal balance by chelating certain 
biometals. Our results showed that all of the tested hydrazones were potent 
inhibitors of human cholinesterases with inhibition constants (Ki) in micromolar 
range able to lower the activity of β-secretase, inhibit amyloid aggregation, 
chelate biometals and act as antioxidants. Also, most of them were estimated to 
be able to cross the blood-brain barrier by passive transport and to be absorbed 
in human intestines as well as with moderate metabolic stability in liver 
microsomes.

This study aims to investigate the effect of promethazine (PMZ) on hippocampal 
neuronal injury through network pharmacology and in vivo experiments. Network 
pharmacology: The intersection genes of PMZ and Alzheimer Disease (AD) were 
obtained, and the core genes of PMZ in AD were screened. The intersection genes 
were enriched by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. In the in vitro experiment, mouse 
hippocampal neurons (HT22) were divided into control, glutamate (GLU) model, and 
GLU + PMZ treatment groups. The control group was given a complete culture 
medium, the model group was given GLU for 24 hours, the treatment group was 
given PMZ pretreatment for 3 hours, and then GLU was administered for 24 hours. 
Cell viability was determined, cell morphology was observed by microscopy, 
reactive oxygen species levels and glutathione content were detected, and 
protein expression of P53, PTGS2, SLC7A11, and GPX4 was detected by western 
blotting. Network pharmacology: A total of 317 PMZ targets, 1934 AD genes, 125 
intersection genes, and 18 core genes, including P53 and PTGS2. Gene Ontology 
enrichment analysis showed that the effect of PMZ on AD was mainly related to 
cell proliferation, inflammation, hypoxia, synaptic structure, plasma membrane, 
and oxidoreductase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results 
showed neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cell senescence, cancer pathway, 
PI3K-AKT signal pathway, neurodegeneration, and HIF-1 signal pathway. In vitro 
experiments: PMZ improved the GLU-induced decrease in cell viability and 
morphological changes in hippocampal neurons. PMZ inhibited reactive oxygen 
species levels and increased glutathione content in injured hippocampal neurons. 
Up-regulated of P53, SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression, and inhibited expression of 
PTGS2. PMZ regulates the SLC7A11-GPX4 antioxidant system to protect hippocampal 
neurons from oxidative stress injury.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have attracted interest as therapeutic 
targets for neurodegenerative diseases. AGEs facilitate the onset and 
progression of various neurogenerative disorders due to their ability to promote 
cross-linking and aggregation of proteins. Further, the interaction between AGEs 
and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) activates neuroinflammatory, oxidative stress and 
excitotoxicity processes that contribute to neuronal cell death. Various 
therapeutic efforts have targeted lowering the production of AGEs, inhibiting 
RAGE or inhibiting some of the processes of the AGE-RAGE axis as potential 
treatments for these disorders. Whereas effective treatments for many 
neurodegenerative disorders remain elusive, such efforts offer promise to slow 
the progression of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD).

INTRODUCTION: Memory impairment is a critical challenge in neurodegenerative 
disorders, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and 
age-related cognitive decline. This research explores the molecular mechanisms 
by which curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from Curcuma longa, exerts 
neuroprotective effects that may ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with 
these conditions.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Evidence from both preclinical studies and emerging 
clinical trials indicates that curcumin enhances neuronal signaling and synaptic 
plasticity, primarily through the modulation of pathways such as NF-κB and 
PI3K/Akt. Specifically, curcumin has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and 
oxidative stress, thereby promoting synaptic integrity and function. For 
instance, studies demonstrate that curcumin treatment increases the density of 
dendritic spines in the hippocampus, which correlates with improved spatial 
learning and memory performance in animal models. Despite promising findings, 
significant gaps remain in our understanding of curcumin's efficacy in humans. 
Most existing research is derived from animal studies, with limited large-scale 
clinical trials to substantiate its therapeutic potential. Furthermore, 
challenges such as curcumin's low bioavailability and inconsistencies in dosing 
complicate its clinical application. This review underscores the need for future 
research focused on enhancing curcumin's bioavailability, establishing optimal 
dosages, and conducting comprehensive human trials to validate its 
effectiveness. By addressing these issues, we aim to clarify curcumin's role as 
a potential therapeutic agent for memory impairment in neurodegenerative 
disorders, paving the way for innovative treatment strategies.

Increasing evidence points to a pivotal role of immune processes in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, which is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
and dementia-causing disease of our time. Multiple lines of information provided 
by experimental, epidemiological, neuropathological and genetic studies suggest 
a pathological role for innate and adaptive immune activation in this disease. 
Here, we review the cell types and pathological mechanisms involved in disease 
development as well as the influence of genetics and lifestyle factors. Given 
the decade-long preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease, these mechanisms and 
their interactions are driving forces behind the spread and progression of the 
disease. The identification of treatment opportunities will require a precise 
understanding of the cells and mechanisms involved as well as a clear definition 
of their temporal and topographical nature. We will also discuss new therapeutic 
strategies for targeting neuroinflammation, which are now entering the clinic 
and showing promise for patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral 
changes, impacting millions of individuals worldwide. Despite significant 
research into its cellular and molecular mechanisms, no cure has been found to 
treat AD to date. For over two decades, research aimed at treating AD has 
focused on targeting amyloid-β (Aβ); however, these strategies have not 
demonstrated substantial effectiveness. Consequently, research is now expanding 
towards targeting other hallmarks of the disease, such as tau protein and brain 
metal ions. Among potential therapeutics against these pathophysiological 
targets, peptide-based inhibitors are notable for their high selectivity and low 
toxicity. Despite these advantages, they face obstacles such as a short 
half-life in vivo and low efficiencies in crossing the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). The use of nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver peptide-based inhibitors to the 
brain offers unique advantages, such as enhanced stability against degradation, 
improvement in targeted delivery, and reduced potential for immunogenic 
responses. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of emerging 
peptides tested as treatments for AD against Aβ, tau protein, and brain metal 
ions and to evaluate NPs as a means to overcome the limitations. These 
peptide-based inhibitors are promising, as they not only alleviate symptoms but 
also aim to prevent progressive neuronal loss, and NPs can be highly effective 
in delivering these inhibitors.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) has been shown to treat a variety of human diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its mechanism in AD needs further 
investigation. Microglial cells (BV2) were treated with Aβ1-42 to induce AD cell 
models. Cell viability and apoptosis were tested by cell counting kit 8 assay 
and flow cytometry. The protein levels of GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4), 
phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A), autophagy-related markers, M1/M2 
polarization-related markers and PI3K/AKT-related markers were detected by 
western blot. Inflammation factors were detected by ELISA. Jaspar and 
dual-luciferase reporter assay were used to evaluate the interaction between 
GATA4 and PDE4A. Our results showed that Rg1 promoted viability and autophagy, 
while suppressed apoptosis and inflammation in Aβ1-42-induced BV2 cells. Rg1 
reduced GATA4 protein expression, and GATA4 upregulation reversed the regulation 
of Rg1 on Aβ1-42-induced BV2 cell injury. GATA4 interacted with PDE4A, and GATA4 
facilitated Aβ1-42-induced BV2 cell injury by increasing PDE4A expression. 
Besides, GATA4 knockdown reduced PDE4A protein expression and inactivated 
PI3K/AKT axis, while these effects were abolished by PDE4A overexpression. In 
conclusion, our data suggested that Ginsenoside Rg1 inhibited microglial cell 
apoptosis and inflammation to attenuate AD progression by regulating the 
GATA4/PDE4A/PI3K/AKT axis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually progressive neurodegenerative disease 
with a serious impact on patients' quality of life. However, single-targeted 
therapies are not currently effective, and there is a need to find pluripotent 
drugs with multiple properties. This study aimed to characterize the metabolism 
of neurotransmitters using a targeted metabolomics approach and to identify the 
major metabolic pathways mainly affected by 6‴-feruloylspinosin (6-FS). The 
mechanism of action of 6-FS in the treatment of AD was elucidated based on 
experimental validation. The metabolomics analysis revealed changes in 13 
metabolic profiles by the LC-MS/MS, with significant changes in five amino 
acid-related neurotransmitters identified primarily. Based on the correlations, 
we found an effect of mTOR inhibition on the above neurotransmitter metabolism. 
Furthermore, pretreatment with 6-FS activated the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, 
promoting cellular autophagy, regulating oxidative stress homeostasis and 
inhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction. In short, these comprehensive analysis 
methods help clarify the preventive mechanism of 6-FS and potential targets in 
AD and provide the necessary support for developing natural products to prevent 
AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia with 
multi-layered complexity in its molecular etiology. Multiple omics-based 
approaches, such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, 
metabolomics, and lipidomics are enabling researchers to dissect this molecular 
complexity, and to uncover a plethora of alterations yielding insights into the 
pathophysiology of this disease. These approaches reveal multi-omics alterations 
essentially in all cell types of the brain, including glia. In this systematic 
review, we screen the literature for human studies implementing any omics 
approach within the last 10 years, to discover AD-associated molecular 
perturbations in brain glial cells. The findings from over 200 AD-related 
studies are reviewed under four different glial cell categories: microglia, 
oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and brain vascular cells. Under each category, we 
summarize the shared and unique molecular alterations identified in glial cells 
through complementary omics approaches. We discuss the implications of these 
findings for the development, progression and ultimately treatment of this 
complex disease as well as directions for future omics studies in glia cells.

IMPORTANCE: Increasing numbers of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) use 
disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Long-term stable disease while taking such 
medications provides a rationale for considering DMT discontinuation given 
patient burden, costs, and potential adverse effects of immunomodulating 
therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether first-line DMT can be safely discontinued in 
patients with long-term stable MS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, rater-blinded, 
noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted between July 1, 2020, and 
March 20, 2023, at 14 Dutch centers. Data analysis was performed between July 
2023 and January 2024. Key inclusion criteria were relapse-onset MS, aged 18 
years or older, without relapses, and without substantial magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) activity in the previous 5 years under first-line DMT. 
Participants were randomized 1:1 to discontinue or continue first-line DMT.
INTERVENTION: Discontinuation of first-line DMT.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was significant inflammatory 
disease activity, defined as relapse and/or 3 or more new T2 lesions or 2 or 
more contrast-enhancing lesions on brain MRI.
RESULTS: Of 163 potentially eligible participants, 89 participants were included 
in the trial at the moment of early termination. Forty-four participants (49.4%) 
were assigned to the continue group and 45 participants (50.6%) were assigned to 
the discontinue group. Median (IQR) age was 54.0 (49.0-59.0) years, and 60 
participants (67.4%) were female. Two participants in the continue group were 
lost to follow-up. After a median (IQR) follow-up time of 15.3 (11.4-23.9) 
months, the trial was prematurely terminated because of inflammatory disease 
activity recurrence above the predefined limit. In total, 8 of 45 participants 
in the discontinue group (17.8%) vs 0 of 44 participants in the continue group 
reached the primary end point and had recurrent, mostly radiological 
inflammation. Two of these 8 participants had a clinical relapse. Median (IQR) 
time to disease activity was 12.0 (6.0-12.0) months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, even in patients 
with long-term MS stable for over 5 years, first-line DMT discontinuation can 
lead to recurrence of inflammatory disease activity. Although this study cohort 
was relatively small, the recurrence of inflammation in the discontinue group 
was significantly higher than in the continue group and also higher than in the 
previously published DISCOMS trial, which only included individuals aged 55 
years or older. This study provides additional data, especially in a younger 
population and including longitudinal biomarker measurements, for informed 
decision-making in cases when treatment discontinuation is considered.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the mechanisms of spontaneous brain 
activity of white matter functional signals in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients 
after donepezil intervention.
METHODS: We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and the 
fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) approach to 
investigate changes in spontaneous brain activity of white matter functional 
signals in AD patients before and after donepezil intervention. A total of 32 
subjects participated in the study, including 16 healthy subjects (HCs) and 16 
AD patients. The 16 AD patients underwent brain imaging and neuropsychological 
assessment before and after donepezil. ANOVA and post hoc t-test analysis were 
used to compare the differences in fALFF between the three groups. Pearson 
correlations were used to investigate the relationships between abnormal fALFF 
values and clinical variables in AD patients before and after intervention 
(P < 0.05).
RESULTS: Compared to HCs, AD patients before donepezil intervention had an 
abnormal fALFF in superior longitudinal fasciculus 2; AD patients after 
donepezil intervention had an abnormal fALFF in right superior longitudinal 
fasciculus 1,2 and right dorsal cingulum, Compared with baseline, AD patients 
after donepezil intervention had an abnormal fALFF in the right dorsal cingulum. 
Compared with the baseline, AD patients after donepezil intervention had 
significantly decreased depression scores (P < 0.0003).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that spontaneous activity of functional signalling 
in the cholinergic pathway was altered in AD patients after donepezil 
intervention and that this change was associated with depressive symptoms in AD 
patients.

impacts has prompted a global focus in the field. In recent years, there has 
been a growing understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD, including the 
aggregation of β-amyloid, hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuroinflammation. These 
processes collectively lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, which 
ultimately results in the loss of autonomy in patients. Currently, there are 
three main types of AD treatments: clinical tools, pharmacological treatment, 
and material interventions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the 
underlying etiology and pathogenesis of AD, as well as an overview of the 
current prevalence of AD treatments. We believe this article can help deepen our 
understanding of the AD mechanism, and facilitate the clinical translation of 
scientific research or therapies, to address this global problem of AD.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) remain the first-line treatment for 
Alzheimer's disease. However, these drugs are largely symptomatic and often 
associated with adverse effects. This study aimed to evaluate novel 
pharmacophores for their in vitro AChEI activity, blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability, and cytotoxic potential, hypothesizing that a combination of 
AChEIs could enhance symptom management while minimizing toxicity. A library of 
1453 synthetic pharmacophores was assessed using in vitro and in silico methods 
to determine their feasibility as an inhibitor of the AChE enzyme. An in-house 
miniaturized Ellman's assay determined acellular AChEI activities, while 
pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated using the SwissADME web tool. The 
combinational effects of in silico BBB-permeable pharmacophores and donepezil 
were examined using a checkerboard AChEI assay. Cytotoxicity of active compounds 
and their synergistic combinations was assessed in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and 
bEnd.5 cells using the sulforhodamine B assay. Cellular AChEI activity of active 
in silico BBB-permeable predicted compounds was determined using an SH-SY5Y 
AChE-based assay. An in vitro BBB model was used to assess the effect of 
compounds on the integrity of the bEnd.5 monolayer. Out of the screened 
compounds, 12 demonstrated 60% AChEI activity at 5 μM, with compound A51 showing 
the lowest IC50 (0.20 μM). Five compounds were identified as BBB-permeable, with 
the donepezil-C53 combination at ¼IC50 exhibiting the strongest synergy 
(CI = 0.82). Compounds A136 and C129, either alone or with donepezil, showed 
cytotoxicity. Notably, compound C53, both alone and in combination with 
donepezil, demonstrated high AChEI activity and promising BBB permeability, 
warranting further investigation.

BACKGROUND: This study investigates the effects of intranasal dantrolene 
nanoparticles on inflammation and programmed cell death by pyroptosis in 5XFAD 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mice.
METHODS: 5XFAD and wild type (WT) B6SJLF1/J mice were treated with intranasal 
dantrolene nanoparticles (5 mg/kg), daily, Monday to Friday, for 12 weeks 
continuously, starting at 9 months of age. Blood and brain were harvested at 13 
months of age, one month after completion of 12 weeks intranasal dantrolene 
nanoparticle treatment. Blood biomarkers function of liver (Alanine 
transaminase, ALT), kidney (Creatinine), and thyroid (TSH: Thyroid-stimulating 
hormone) were measured using ELISA. The changes of whole brain tissue proteins 
on Ca 2+ release channels on membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (type 2 ryanodine 
and type 1 InsP3 receptors, RyR-2 and InsP3R-1), lipid peroxidation byproduct 
malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified proteins, 4-HNE, pyroptosis regulatory proteins 
(NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, full length or 
N-terminal of Gasdermin D (GSDMD), cytotoxic (IL-1, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-a) and 
cytoprotective (IL-10) cytokines, astrogliosis (GFAP), microgliosis (IBA-1) and 
synapse proteins (PSD-95, Synapsin-1) were determined using immunoblotting. Body 
weights were monitored regularly.
RESULTS: Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles significantly inhibited the 
increase of RyR-2 and InsP3R-1 proteins, MDA-modified proteins, 4-NHE, 
pyroptosis regulatory proteins (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal GSDMD), 
cytotoxic cytokine (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α), biomarkers for astrogliosis 
(GFAP) and microgliosis (IBA-1), and the decrease of cytoprotective cytokine 
(IL-10) and synaptic proteins (PSD-95, synpasin-1). Intranasal dantrolene 
nanoparticles for 12 weeks did not affect blood biomarkers for function of 
liver, kidney, and thyroid, not did it change body weight significantly.
CONCLUSION: Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles significantly inhibit the 
increase of RyR-2 and InsP 3 R-1 Ca 2+ channel receptor proteins, ameliorate 
activation of the pyroptosis pathway and pathological inflammation, and the 
associated loss of synapse proteins. Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles for 
three months did not affect liver, kidney and thyroid functions or cause other 
side effects.

OBJECTIVE: The easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS) objectively interprets brain 
perfusion. Using eZIS-processed images, we observed decreased regional cerebral 
blood flow (rCBF) in the left putamen of several patients with forgetfulness. 
This study aimed to examine this decrease using statistical image analysis.
METHODS: Cerebral perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 
was performed on patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Normalized and corrected SPECT images were compared 
between patients and controls using Statistical Parametric Mapping software 
(SPM12, The Wellcome Center for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute 
of Neurology, London, UK). Eigenvariate values of clusters with significantly 
low and high rCBF were obtained. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then 
used to examine the relationships among these clusters.
RESULTS: We observed decreased rCBF in the left insula, operculum, and putamen, 
indicating that the reduction extended laterally from the initial eZIS-based 
findings. We obtained eight decreased and seven increased eigenvariate values 
for abnormal rCBF clusters. PCA revealed that the left insula, operculum, and 
putamen were the most influential principal components, along with the posterior 
cingulate and precuneus cortices. The eigenvariate values in these regions did 
not correlate with sex, diagnosis (AD or MCI), or cognitive scores.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported the decreased rCBF in the left insula, operculum, and 
putamen. However, its clinical significance beyond the associations with 
forgetfulness and its natural radiological course remains unclear.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent forms of 
dementia globally and remains an incurable condition that often leads to death. 
PANoptosis represents an emerging paradigm in programmed cell death, integrating 
three critical processes: pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Studies have 
shown that apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis play important roles in AD 
development. Therefore, targeting PANoptosis genes might lead to novel 
therapeutic targets and clinically relevant therapeutic approaches. This study 
aims to identify different molecular subtypes of AD and potential drugs for 
treating AD based on PANoptosis.
METHODS: Differentially expressed PANoptosis genes associated with AD were 
identified via Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE48350, GSE5281, and 
GSE122063. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression 
was employed to construct a risk model linked to these PANoptosis genes. 
Consensus clustering analysis was conducted to define AD subtypes based on these 
genes. We further performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA), functional 
enrichment analysis, and immune cell infiltration analysis to investigate 
differences between the identified AD subtypes. Additionally, a protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was established to identify hub genes, and the DGIdb 
database was consulted to identify potential therapeutic compounds targeting 
these hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was utilized to assess 
differences in gene expression at the cellular level across subtypes.
RESULTS: A total of 24 differentially expressed PANoptosis genes (APANRGs) were 
identified in AD, leading to the classification of two distinct AD subgroups. 
The results indicate that these subgroups exhibit varying disease progression 
states, with the early subtype primarily linked to dysfunctional synaptic 
signaling. Furthermore, we identified hub genes from the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between the two clusters and predicted 38 candidate drugs 
and compounds for early AD treatment based on these hub genes. Single-cell RNA 
sequencing analysis revealed that key genes associated with the early subtype 
are predominantly expressed in neuronal cells, while the differential genes for 
the metabolic subtype are primarily found in endothelial cells and astrocytes.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we identified two subtypes, including the AD early 
synaptic abnormality subtype as well as the immune-metabolic subtype. 
Additionally, ten hub genes, SLC17A7, SNAP25, GAD1, SLC17A6, SLC32A1, PVALB, 
SYP, GRIN2A, SLC12A5, and SYN2, were identified as marker genes for the early 
subtype. These findings may provide valuable insights for the early diagnosis of 
AD and contribute to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.

In the rapidly evolving healthcare sector, using advanced technologies to 
improve medical classification systems has become crucial for enhancing patient 
care, diagnosis, and treatment planning. There are two main challenges faced in 
this domain (i) imbalanced distribution of medical data, leading to biased model 
performance and (ii) the need to preserve patient privacy and comply with data 
protection regulations. The primary goal of this project is to develop a medical 
classification model for Alzheimer's disease detection that can effectively 
learn from decentralized and imbalanced datasets without compromising on data 
privacy. The proposed system aims to address these challenges by employing an 
approach that combines split federated learning (SFL) with conditional 
generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to enhance medical classification 
models. SFL enables efficient set of distributed agents that collaboratively 
train learning models without sharing their data, thus improving data privacy 
and the integration of conditional GANs aims to improve the model's ability to 
generalize across imbalanced classes by generating realistic synthetic samples 
for minority classes. The proposed system provided an accuracy of approximately 
83.54 percentage for the Alzheimer's disease classification dataset.

INTRODUCTION: Targeted proteomic assays may be useful for diagnosing and staging 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We evaluated the performance 
of a 120-marker central nervous system (CNS) NUcleic acid-Linked Immuno-Sandwich 
Assay (NULISA) panel in samples spanning the AD spectrum.
METHODS: Cross-sectional plasma samples (n=252) were analyzed using Alamar's 
NULISAseq CNS panel. ROC analyses demonstrated NULISAseq-pTau217 accuracy in 
detecting amyloid (A) and tau (T) PET positivity. Differentially expressed 
proteins were identified using volcano plots.
RESULTS: NULISAseq-pTau217 accurately classified A/T PET status with ROC AUCs of 
0.92/0.86. pTau217 was upregulated in A+, T+, and impaired groups with log2-fold 
changes of 1.21, 0.57 and 4.63, respectively, compared to A-. Interestingly, 
pTDP43-409 was also upregulated in the impaired group and correlated with 
declining hippocampal volume and cognitive trajectories.
DISCUSSION: This study shows the potential of a targeted proteomics panel for 
characterizing brain changes pertinent to ADRD. The promising pTDP43-409 
findings require further replication.

Cognitive resilience (CR) contributes to the variability in risk for developing 
and progressing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) among individuals. Beyond genetics, 
recent studies highlight the critical role of lifestyle factors in enhancing CR 
and delaying cognitive decline. DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic mechanism 
influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, including CR-related 
lifestyle factors, offers a promising pathway for understanding the biology of 
CR. We studied DNAm changes associated with the Resilience Index (RI), a 
composite measure of lifestyle factors, using blood samples from the Healthy 
Brain Initiative (HBI) cohort. After corrections for multiple comparisons, our 
analysis identified 19 CpGs and 24 differentially methylated regions 
significantly associated with the RI, adjusting for covariates age, sex, APOE 
ε4, and immune cell composition. The RI-associated methylation changes are 
significantly enriched in pathways related to lipid metabolism, synaptic 
plasticity, and neuroinflammation, and highlight the connection between 
cardiovascular health and cognitive function. By identifying RI-associated DNAm, 
our study provided an alternative approach to discovering future targets and 
treatment strategies for AD, complementary to the traditional approach of 
identifying disease-associated variants directly. Furthermore, we developed a 
Methylation-based Resilience Score (MRS) that successfully predicted future 
cognitive decline in an external dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), even after accounting for age, sex, APOE ε4, 
years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline MMSE score. Our findings 
are particularly relevant for a better understanding of epigenetic architecture 
underlying cognitive resilience. Importantly, the significant association 
between baseline MRS and future cognitive decline demonstrated that DNAm could 
be a predictive marker for AD, laying the foundation for future studies on 
personalized AD prevention.

Neurogenesis has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for central nervous 
system disorders. The role of neuronal mitochondria in neurogenesis is 
well-studied, however, recent evidence underscores the critical role of 
astrocytic mitochondrial function in regulating neurogenesis and the underlying 
mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This review highlights the regulatory 
effects of astrocyte mitochondria on neurogenesis, focusing on metabolic 
support, calcium homeostasis, and the secretion of neurotrophic factors. The 
effect of astrocytic mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology and 
treatment strategies of Alzheimer's disease and depression is discussed. Greater 
attention is needed to investigate the mitochondrial autophagy, dynamics, 
biogenesis, and energy metabolism in neurogenesis. Targeting astrocyte 
mitochondria presents a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing neural 
regeneration.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stem cell therapy shows great promise for treating 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) like donepezil are 
well-established for alleviating AD symptoms. This study aimed to determine if 
combining ChEI treatment with stem cell therapy could improve therapeutic 
outcomes.
METHODS: Neural stem cells (NSCs) were injected into the hippocampus of the 
5xFAD AD mice using a stereotactic technique. Following this, donepezil or a 
placebo was administered for one month. We assessed behavioral improvements, 
survival and health of the grafts, and changes in synaptic density.
RESULTS: The AD mice demonstrated cognitive impairment in both the Morris water 
maze and novel object recognition tests. In groups receiving stem cell therapy, 
donepezil enhanced the survival and neuronal differentiation of grafted NSCs, 
promoting the establishment of synaptic connections with the host brain. The 
combined treatment with donepezil and NSC transplantation more effectively 
increased synaptic density and improved behavioral performance in AD mice 
compared to NSC transplantation alone.
CONCLUSION: Combining ChEIs with NSC transplantation produces synergistic 
effects in AD treatment. This approach highlights the potential of integrating 
these therapies to develop more effective strategies for managing Alzheimer's 
disease.

Positive caregiving appraisal is strongly linked to health among caregivers of 
persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). This study 
hypothesized that race and ethnicity, as well as cultural factors, would predict 
positive caregiving appraisal. One-hundred thirty-six racially and ethnically 
diverse ADRD caregivers completed a cross-sectional survey. Race and ethnicity 
did not predict positive appraisal. However, culture-based values around 
caregiving and perceived provider cultural competence did predict positive 
appraisal. Findings reinforce the need to assess and incorporate culture-based 
values in services for ADRD caregivers and the importance of provider cultural 
competence when working with diverse ADRD family caregivers.

Viruses pose a significant challenge and threat to human health, as demonstrated 
by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Neurodegeneration, particularly in the case of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), is significantly influenced by viral infections. AD is 
a neurodegenerative disease that affects people of all ages and poses a 
significant threat to millions of individuals worldwide. The precise mechanism 
behind its development is not yet fully understood; however, the emergence and 
advancement of AD can be hastened by various environmental factors, such as 
bacterial and viral infections. There has been a longstanding suspicion that the 
herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) may have a role to play in the development or 
advancement of AD. Reactivation of HSV-1 could potentially lead to damage to 
neurons, either by direct means or indirectly by triggering inflammation. This 
article provides an overview of the connection between HSV-1 infections and 
immune cells (astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes) in the progression of 
AD. It summarizes recent scientific research on how HSV-1 affects neurons, which 
could potentially shed light on the clinical features and treatment options for 
AD. In addition, the paper has explored the impact of HSV-1 on neurons and its 
role in various aspects of AD, such as Aβ secretion, tau hyperphosphorylation, 
metabolic dysregulation, oxidative damage, apoptosis, and autophagy. It is 
believed that the immune response triggered by HSV-1 reactivation plays a role 
in the development of neurodegeneration in AD. Despite the lack of a cure for 
AD, researchers have made significant efforts to study the clinical and 
pathological aspects of the disease, identify biomarkers, and gain insight into 
its underlying causes. The goal is to achieve early diagnosis and develop 
treatments that can modify the progression of the disease. The current article 
discusses the most promising therapy for combating the viral impacts, which 
provides additional evidence for the frequent reactivations of latent HSV-1 in 
the AD brain. However, further research is still required to establish the 
molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of AD through the 
reactivation of HSV-1. This could potentially lead to new insights in drug 
development aimed at preventing HSV-1 reactivation and the subsequent 
development and progression of AD.

Brexpirazole was approved for the treatment of nonpsychotic agitation in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in May 2023 after three phase 3 clinical trials found 
brexpiprazole 2 to 3 mg/day to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for 
agitation in AD dementia, albeit with small effect sizes. It appeared to 
especially benefit dementia patients with severe agitation/aggression, but it 
took between 6 and 12 weeks across the three studies for the medication to 
separate from placebo. However, much remains unknown about its place in the 
psychopharmacological armamentarium for the treatment of AD dementia-related 
agitation, including the optimal duration of a brexpiprazole trial, bridging 
options during the time it takes for brexpiprazole to become effective, and 
whether it should be continued in the presence of or upon emergence of psychosis 
during treatment. This Research in Action article uses a case vignette to 
synthesize the findings of the brexpiprazole trials and apply them to clinical 
practice, highlight the current uncertainties associated with its use, and 
compare it with other psychopharmacological options for the treatment of 
agitation in AD dementia.

Diabetes has been regarded as an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Liraglutide could improve cognition in AD mouse models, but its precise 
mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used STZ-induced diabetic rats and 
HT-22 cells to investigate the effects of liraglutide. The MWM test, MTT assay, 
ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence were used in this research. Diabetic 
rats induced by STZ displayed a longer escape latency and entered the target 
zone less frequently (p < 0.05) in the MWM test. Intraperitoneal injection of 
liraglutide improved the cognition of diabetic rats (p < 0.05) and reduced Aβ42 
expression in the hippocampus (p < 0.05). In vivo experiments showed that HT-22 
cell viability decreased in the HG group, but liraglutide (100 nmol/L and 1 
μmol/L) enhanced HT-22 cell viability (p < 0.05). Oxidative stress markers were 
upregulated in HT-22 cells in the HG group, while liraglutide treatment 
significantly reduced these markers (p < 0.05). Western blot and 
immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated increased levels of Aβ, BACE1, and 
γ-secretase in HT-22 cells in the HG group (p < 0.05), whereas these levels were 
reduced in the liraglutide treatment group (p < 0.05). These effects were 
reversed by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitors (p < 0.05). These findings 
suggest that liraglutide improved the cognition of diabetic rats and might exert 
its protective effects by reducing oxidative stress, downregulating BACE1 and 
γ-secretase expression, and decreasing Aβ deposition via the NF-κB and ERK1/2 
pathways.

Aberrant autophagic flux and epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the 
development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, limited studies have been 
conducted on the relationship between the histone acetylation-particularly 
sirtuin 2 (SIRT2)-and autophagy in cognitive deficiency. We investigated the 
effects of a walnut-derived peptide (WNP-8) on SIRT2, synaptic plasticity, and 
autophagy and the involvement of SIRT2 in learning and memory. Using 
four-dimensional label-free quantitative proteomics, we analyzed hippocampal 
tissue from mice treated or not treated with WNP-8 and exposed to scopolamine 
and identified 71 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). A 
pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEPs were mostly located in the 
cytoplasm and involved in the negative regulation of cell proliferation and 
nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, which are associated with SIRT2. Western 
blotting and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that pretreatment with 
WNP-8 significantly modulated the expression of synaptic and autophagic proteins 
in scopolamine-treated cells in both in vivo and in vitro models (p < .05). 
Notably, WNP-8 significantly reversed the level and morphology of synaptic 
plasticity and autophagic flux in PC12 cells that overexpressed SIRT2 (p < .05). 
Together, our results provide evidence of a link between SIRT2, autophagy, and 
synaptic plasticity in neurons and novel insights into a potential predictive 
biomarker that could be used to prevent and delay Alzheimer's disease.

As the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise, the need for an 
effective PET radiotracer to facilitate early diagnosis has become more pressing 
than ever before in modern medicine. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) is closely related 
to cognitive impairment and neuroinflammatory processes in AD. Current research 
progress shows that specific PDE4D inhibitors radioligands can bind specifically 
to the PDE4D enzyme in the brain, thereby showing pathology-related signal 
enhancement in AD animal models, indicating the potential of these ligands as 
effective radiotracers. At the same time, we need to pay attention to the 
important role computer aided drug design (CADD) plays in advancing AD drug 
design and PET imaging. Future research will verify the potential of these 
ligands in clinical applications through computer simulation techniques, 
providing patients with timely intervention and treatment, which is of great 
significance.

Cardio-cerebral diseases (CCDs), encompassing conditions such as coronary heart 
disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, et al., represent a 
significant threat to human health and well-being. These diseases are often 
characterized by metabolic abnormalities and remodeling in the process of 
pathology. Glycolysis and hypoxia-induced lactate accumulation play critical 
roles in cellular energy dynamics and metabolic imbalances in CCDs. Lactylation, 
a post-translational modification driven by excessive lactate accumulation, 
occurs in both histone and non-histone proteins. It has been implicated in 
regulating protein function across various pathological processes in CCDs, 
including inflammation, angiogenesis, lipid metabolism dysregulation, and 
fibrosis. Targeting key proteins involved in lactylation, as well as the enzymes 
regulating this modification, holds promise as a therapeutic strategy to 
modulate disease progression by addressing these pathological mechanisms. This 
review provides a holistic picture of the types of lactylation and the 
associated modifying enzymes, highlights the roles of lactylation in different 
pathological processes, and synthesizes the latest clinical evidence and 
preclinical studies in a comprehensive view. We aim to emphasize the potential 
of lactylation as an innovative therapeutic target for preventing and treating 
CCD-related conditions.

Hesperidin, a flavonoid glycoside, is a natural phenolic compound that has broad 
biological effects. Increasing evidence suggests that hesperidin inhibits the 
occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This article reviews the neuropharmacological mechanisms of 
hesperidin in the prevention and treatment of AD through in vitro and in vivo 
studies. A systematic review of preclinical studies was conducted using PubMed, 
Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar (up to July 1, 2024). The 
neuroprotective potential of hesperidin was mediated through mechanisms such as 
inhibition of β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, enhancement of endogenous antioxidant 
defense functions, reduction of neuroinflammation and apoptosis, improvement of 
mitochondrial dysfunction, regulation of autophagy, and promotion of 
neurogenesis. Despite various preclinical studies on the role of hesperidin in 
AD, its exact effects on humans remain unclear. Few clinical trials have 
indicated that dietary supplements rich in hesperidin can improve cerebral blood 
flow, cognition, and memory performance. The neuroprotective effect of 
hesperidin may be exerted via regulating different molecular pathways, including 
the RAGE/NF-κB, Akt/Nrf2, and AMPK/BDNF/CREB pathways. However, further clinical 
trials are needed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of this natural 
flavonoid compound and to assess its safety.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a considerable worldwide health obstacle, marked 
by gradual cognitive deterioration and neuronal loss. While the molecular 
mechanisms underlying AD pathology have been elucidated to some extent, 
therapeutic options remain limited. Mitochondrial dysfunction has become 
recognized as a significant factor in the development of AD, with oxidative 
stress and disrupted energy metabolism being critical elements. This review 
explores the mechanistic aspects of small molecule targeting of mitochondria as 
a potential therapeutic approach for AD. The review explores the role of 
mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, including its involvement in the accumulation 
of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and 
neuronal death. Furthermore, the effects of oxidative stress on mitochondrial 
function were investigated, including the resulting damage to mitochondrial 
components. Mitochondrial-targeted therapies have attracted attention for their 
potential to restore mitochondrial function and reduce AD pathology. The review 
outlines the latest preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the 
effectiveness of small molecules in targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. 
Additionally, it discusses the molecular pathways involved in mitochondrial 
dysfunction and examines how small molecules can intervene to address these 
abnormalities. By providing a comprehensive overview of the latest research in 
this field, this review aims to shed light on the therapeutic potential of small 
molecule targeting of mitochondria in AD and stimulate further research in this 
promising area of drug development.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2021 provides a comprehensive assessment of health and risk factor trends 
at global, regional, national, and subnational levels. This study aims to 
examine the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the USA and 
highlight the disparities in health outcomes across different states.
METHODS: GBD 2021 analysed trends in mortality, morbidity, and disability for 
371 diseases and injuries and 88 risk factors in the USA between 1990 and 2021. 
We used several metrics to report sources of health and health loss related to 
specific diseases, injuries, and risk factors. GBD 2021 methods accounted for 
differences in data sources and biases. The analysis of levels and trends for 
causes and risk factors within the same computational framework enabled 
comparisons across states, years, age groups, and sex. GBD 2021 estimated years 
lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum 
of years of life lost to premature mortality and YLDs) for 371 diseases and 
injuries, years of life lost (YLLs) and mortality for 288 causes of death, and 
life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We provided estimates for 88 
risk factors in relation to 155 health outcomes for 631 risk-outcome pairs and 
produced risk-specific estimates of summary exposure value, relative health 
risk, population attributable fraction, and risk-attributable burden measured in 
DALYs and deaths. Estimates were produced by sex (male and female), age (25 age 
groups from birth to ≥95 years), and year (annually between 1990 and 2021). 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2·5th 
and 97·5th percentiles values of 500 draws (ie, 500 random samples from the 
estimate's distribution). Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the 
estimation process.
FINDINGS: We found disparities in health outcomes and risk factors across US 
states. Our analysis of GBD 2021 highlighted the relative decline in life 
expectancy and HALE compared with other countries, as well as the impact of 
COVID-19 during the first 2 years of the pandemic. We found a decline in the 
USA's ranking of life expectancy from 1990 to 2021: in 1990, the USA ranked 35th 
of 204 countries and territories for males and 19th for females, but dropped to 
46th for males and 47th for females in 2021. When comparing life expectancy in 
the best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other 
countries and territories (excluding the USA as a whole), Hawaii (the 
best-ranked state in 1990 and 2021) dropped from sixth-highest life expectancy 
in the world for males and fourth for females in 1990 to 28th for males and 22nd 
for females in 2021. The worst-ranked state in 2021 ranked 107th for males 
(Mississippi) and 99th for females (West Virginia). 14 US states lost life 
expectancy over the study period, with West Virginia experiencing the greatest 
loss (2·7 years between 1990 and 2021). HALE ranking declines were even greater; 
in 1990, the USA was ranked 42nd for males and 32nd for females but dropped to 
69th for males and 76th for females in 2021. When comparing HALE in the 
best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other countries 
and territories, Hawaii ranked 14th highest HALE for males and fifth for females 
in 1990, dropping to 39th for males and 34th for females in 2021. In 2021, West 
Virginia-the lowest-ranked state that year-ranked 141st for males and 137th for 
females. Nationally, age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1990 and 
2021 for many leading causes of death, most notably for ischaemic heart disease 
(56·1% [95% UI 55·1-57·2] decline), lung cancer (41·9% [39·7-44·6]), and breast 
cancer (40·9% [38·7-43·7]). Over the same period, age-standardised mortality 
rates increased for other causes, particularly drug use disorders (878·0% 
[770·1-1015·5]), chronic kidney disease (158·3% [149·6-167·9]), and falls (89·7% 
[79·8-95·8]). We found substantial variation in mortality rates between states, 
with Hawaii having the lowest age-standardised mortality rate (433·2 per 100 000 
[380·6-493·4]) in 2021 and Mississippi having the highest (867·5 per 100 000 
[772·6-975·7]). Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised mortality rates 
throughout the study period, whereas Washington, DC, experienced the most 
improvement (a 40·7% decline [33·2-47·3]). Only six countries had 
age-standardised rates of YLDs higher than the USA in 2021: Afghanistan, 
Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, South Africa, and the Central African Republic, 
largely because the impact of musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, and 
substance use disorders on age-standardised disability rates in the USA is so 
large. At the state level, eight US states had higher age-standardised YLD rates 
than any country in the world: West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, 
New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arizona. Low back pain was the leading cause of 
YLDs in the USA in 1990 and 2021, although the age-standardised rate declined by 
7·9% (1·8-13·0) from 1990. Depressive disorders (56·0% increase [48·2-64·3]) and 
drug use disorders (287·6% [247·9-329·8]) were the second-leading and 
third-leading causes of age-standardised YLDs in 2021. For females, mental 
health disorders had the highest age-standardised YLD rate, with an increase of 
59·8% (50·6-68·5) between 1990 and 2021. Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised 
rates of YLDs for all sexes combined (12 085·3 per 100 000 [9090·8-15 557·1]), 
whereas West Virginia had the highest (14 832·9 per 100 000 
[11 226·9-18 882·5]). At the national level, the leading GBD Level 2 risk 
factors for death for all sexes combined in 2021 were high systolic blood 
pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, and tobacco use. From 1990 to 2021, the 
age-standardised mortality rates attributable to high systolic blood pressure 
decreased by 47·8% (43·4-52·5) and for tobacco use by 5·1% (48·3%-54·1%), but 
rates increased for high fasting plasma glucose by 9·3% (0·4-18·7). The burden 
attributable to risk factors varied by age and sex. For example, for ages 15-49 
years, the leading risk factors for death were drug use, high alcohol use, and 
dietary risks. By comparison, for ages 50-69 years, tobacco was the leading risk 
factor for death, followed by dietary risks and high BMI.
INTERPRETATION: GBD 2021 provides valuable information for policy makers, 
health-care professionals, and researchers in the USA at the national and state 
levels to prioritise interventions, allocate resources effectively, and assess 
the effects of health policies and programmes. By addressing socioeconomic 
determinants, risk behaviours, environmental influences, and health disparities 
among minority populations, the USA can work towards improving health outcomes 
so that people can live longer and healthier lives.

Amyloid fibrils are insoluble, fibrous nanostructures that accumulate 
extracellularly in biological tissue during the progression of several human 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes. Fibrils are 
assembled from protein monomers via the transient formation of soluble, 
cytotoxic oligomers, and have a common molecular architecture consisting of a 
spinal core of hydrogen-bonded protein β-strands. For the past 25 years, NMR 
spectroscopy has been at the forefront of research into the structure and 
assembly mechanisms of amyloid aggregates. Until the recent boom in fibril 
structure analysis by cryo-electron microscopy, solid-state NMR was unrivalled 
in its ability to provide atomic-level models of amyloid fibril architecture. 
Solution-state NMR has also provided complementary information on the early 
stages in the amyloid assembly mechanism. Now, both NMR modalities are proving 
to be valuable in unravelling the complex interactions between amyloid species 
and a diverse range of physiological metal ions, molecules and surfaces that 
influence the assembly pathway, kinetics, morphology and clearance in vivo. 
Here, an overview is presented of the main applications of solid-state and 
solution-state NMR for studying the interactions between amyloid proteins and 
biomembranes, glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides, metal ions, polyphenols, 
synthetic therapeutics and diagnostics. Key NMR methodology is reviewed along 
with examples of how to overcome the challenges of detecting interactions with 
aggregating proteins. The review heralds this new role for NMR in providing a 
comprehensive and pathologically-relevant view of the interactions between 
protein and non-protein components of amyloid. Coverage of both solid- and 
solution-state NMR methods and applications herein will be informative and 
valuable to the broad communities that are interested in amyloid proteins.

Late-onset psychosis (LOP) represents a highly heterogeneous and understudied 
condition, with potential origins ranging from atypically late onset of 
schizophrenia (SCZ) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite the clinical necessity 
of differentiating these conditions to guide effective treatment, achieving an 
accurate diagnosis remains challenging. This study aimed to utilize data-driven 
analyses of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish between 
these diagnostic possibilities. Utilizing publicly available datasets of MRI 
scans from 699 healthy control (HC) participants and 469 patients diagnosed with 
SCZ or AD, our analysis focused on bilateral subcortical volumetric measures in 
the caudate, hippocampus, putamen, and amygdala. We first trained an 
unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm based on SCZ and AD patients and 
achieved a clustering accuracy of 81 % and an area under curvature (AUC) of 0.79 
in distinguishing between these two groups. Subsequently, we calculated the 
Euclidean distance between the AD and SCZ cluster centroids for each of ten 
patients with unexplained onset of psychosis after age 45 from a clinical MRI 
registry. Six patients were classified as AD and four as SCZ. Our findings 
revealed that among LOP participants, those classified in the SCZ cluster 
exhibited significantly greater right putamen volumes compared to those in the 
AD cluster (p < 0.0025). There were also intriguing clinical differences. While 
we do not have diagnostic biomarker information to confirm these 
classifications, this study sheds light on the heterogeneity of psychoses in 
late life and illustrates the potential use of widely available structural MRI 
and data-driven methods to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes 
for LOP patients.

OBJECTIVE: To apply machine learning approaches on EEG event-related 
oscillations (ERO) to discriminate preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) from 
age- and sex-matched controls.
METHODS: Twenty-two cognitively normal preclinical AD participants with elevated 
amyloid and 21 cognitively normal controls without elevated amyloid completed 
n-back working memory tasks (n = 0, 1, 2). The absolute and relative power of 
ERO was extracted using the discrete wavelet transform in the delta, theta, 
alpha, and beta bands. Four machine learning methods were employed, and 
classification performance was assessed using three metrics.
RESULTS: The low-frequency bands produced higher discriminative performances 
compared to high-frequency bands. The 2-back task yielded the best 
classification capability among the three tasks. The highest area under the 
curve value (0.86) was achieved in the 2-back delta band nontarget condition 
data. The highest accuracy (80.47%) was obtained in the 2-back delta and theta 
bands nontarget data. The highest F1 score (0.82) was in the 2-back theta band 
nontarget data. The support vector machine achieved the highest performance 
among tested classifiers.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promise of using machine learning on EEG 
ERO from working memory tasks to detect preclinical AD.
SIGNIFICANCE: EEG ERO may reveal pathophysiological differences in the earliest 
stage of AD when no cognitive impairments are apparent.

OBJECTIVE: To study information needs after receiving abnormal amyloid-PET 
results, and how individual characteristics moderate effects of different 
communication strategies on information recall.
METHODS: In an online video-vignette experiment, seven vignettes each depicted a 
consultation of a physician sharing abnormal amyloid-PET results with a patient 
with Mild Cognitive Impairment(MCI), using different communication strategies. 
Healthy individuals (N = 1017; age 64 ± 8, 808(79 %) female), instructed to 
imagine themselves as the video-patient, viewed a randomly-assigned vignette and 
completed questionnaires to assess information needs and test moderation effects 
of gender, age, care-partner experience, health literacy, and coping.
RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of participants (645/1017) would have liked to 
receive more information, e.g., on prognosis, additional information sources, 
lifestyle advice, and/or treatment. Emotional support benefited information 
recall in women, but not men. Emotional support and visually presenting the 
PET-scan were less beneficial for individuals with a stronger avoidant coping 
style, compared to most other strategies.
CONCLUSION: Most people wanted more information on varying topics, and gender 
and coping style influenced how communication strategies impacted information 
recall. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS The importance of personalized information 
provision was emphasized, both in terms of what information is provided and how 
physicians share information, by paying attention to individuals' needs and 
characteristics.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of tau protein 
tangles and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the central nervous system (CNS), leading 
to progressive neurodegeneration. Hence, the discovery of disease-modifying 
agents capable of delaying the progression is essential for effective 
management. Aminonaphthoquinone (ANQ) is an attractive pharmacophore with 
various biological effects. This study explores the neuroprotective potentials 
of ANQ derivatives (1-18) using in vitro models of AD pathology (i.e., 
Aβ42-induced SH-SY5Y cells). Findings demonstrated that all compounds mitigated 
Aβ42-induced cellular damage by preserving cell viability and morphology. Among 
all, four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) showed potent antioxidant activities as 
well as abilities to minimize AD-related damages (i.e. decreasing intracellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, preserving mitochondrial membrane 
potential (MMP), protecting membrane damage, and modulating beta-secretase 1 
(BACE1) activity) with comparable protective effects to the well-known 
neuroprotectant, resveratrol (RSV). A molecular docking study indicated these 
compounds could suitably bind to sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein with preferable 
affinity. Key amino acid residues and key functional groups essential for 
binding interactions were revealed. Target prediction identified a list of 
possible AD-related targets of these compounds offering insights into their 
mechanisms of action and suggesting their multifunctional potentials. 
Additionally, in silico predictions revealed that these candidates showed 
favorable drug-like properties. Overall, this study highlighted the therapeutic 
potential of ANQ derivatives in AD treatment, emphasizing the need for further 
experimental validation and comprehensive investigations to fully realize their 
therapeutic benefits.

The metabolic syndrome or syndrome X is a clustering of different components 
counting insulin resistance (IR), glucose intolerance, visceral obesity, 
hypertension and dyslipidemia. It has been shown that IR and dysregulation of 
insulin signalling play a critical role in the development of metabolic syndrome 
by initiating the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome through induction of 
glucolipotoxicity, impairment of glucose disposal and triggering of 
pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, metabolic syndrome unfavourably affects 
the cognitive function and the development of different neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) by inducing oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation and brain IR. These changes together with brain IR impair 
cerebrovascular reactivity leading to cognitive impairment. In addition, 
metabolic syndrome increases the risk for the development of AD. However, the 
central mechanisms by which metabolic syndrome amplify AD risk are not 
completely elucidated. Consequently, this narrative review aims to revise from 
published articles the association between metabolic syndrome and AD regarding 
cellular and subcellular pathways. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome is regarded 
as a potential risk factor for the induction of AD neuropathology by different 
signalling pathways such as initiation of brain IR, activation of inflammatory 
signalling pathways and neuroinflammation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder having limited 
treatment options. The beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) is a key target 
for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease. To discover new scaffolds 
for BACE-1 inhibitors, a ChemBridge DIVERSet library of 20,000 small molecules 
was employed to structure-based virtual screening. The top 45 compounds, based 
on docking scores and binding affinities, were tested for BACE-1 inhibitory 
activity using a FRET assay. Four compounds, 18 (5353320), 20 (5262831), 29 
(5784196) and 32 (5794006) demonstrated more than 35 % inhibitory activity at 
10 μM. Notably, pyrazole-5-carbohydrazide 29 (5784196) exhibited BACE-1 
inhibition with an IC50 value of 14.5 μM and a ki value of 0.25 μM. 
Additionally, it also inhibits the self-aggregation of β-amyloid, with IC50 
value of 14.87 μM. Molecular modeling and dynamics simulations provided insights 
into its interaction pattern and stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. 
These findings suggest that virtual screening is an efficient and cost-effective 
method for identifying potential leads for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, 
characterized by the slow and progressive loss of brain structure and function, 
primarily affecting older individuals. Evidence has shown that disruption of 
zinc homeostasis in the brain contributes to synaptic dysfunction, as well as 
impairments in learning and memory. In this study, we evaluated the effect of 
zeolite zinc on memory performance and hippocampal cell death in a rat model of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by intracerebroventricular administration of 
Aβ1-42. We employed the Morris water maze, shuttle box, and open field tests to 
assess spatial memory, passive avoidance memory, and anxiety-like behavior, 
respectively. P-Tau and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, along 
with hippocampal cell death, were also evaluated. Both Aβ1-42 and zeolite zinc 
were injected intracerebroventricularly. The results showed that zeolite zinc 
partially reversed Aβ1-42-induced impairments in memory performance and 
mitigated the effects of Aβ1-42 on locomotor activity, although it did not fully 
restore baseline levels. In addition, Aβ1-42 increased the expression of APP and 
P-Tau, as well as the number of dead cells, whereas zeolite zinc reduced these 
effects. In conclusion, our findings suggest that while zeolite zinc plays a 
role in modulating the pathophysiology of AD, its therapeutic effects only 
partially reverse the progression or symptoms of AD, indicating the need for 
further investigation into optimal dosing or combination therapies.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly heterogeneous and therefore a possible 
cause of translation failure of drugs from animal testing to human treatments 
can be because existing models cannot replicate the entire spectrum of PD 
features. One of the theories of the origin of neurodegenerative diseases 
assumes metabolic dysfunction as a common fundamental thread of disease 
development. Intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin induces 
insulin resistance in the brain (Alzheimer's disease animal model). The aim of 
this project is to examine whether metabolic dysfunction caused by direct 
application of streptozotocin to brain region affected in PD (striatum) can 
induce characteristic PD symptoms. Adult male Wistar rats were given 
streptozotocin bilaterally or unilaterally in striatum. PET scan, cognitive, 
behavioural and motoric functions were tested one month after administration. 
Metabolite and protein analysis was done by untargeted metabolomics, ELISA and 
Western blot. Rats administered bilaterally showed motoric deficit, cognitive 
deficit of spatial learning and memory, fear conditioned and recognition memory, 
and anxiety-like behaviour, accompanied by impaired brain glucose uptake and 
metabolism. The results provide first evidence that bilateral intrastriatal 
administration of streptozotocin (particularly lower dose) can cause development 
of the hallmark PD symptoms. As metabolic dysfunction is increasingly associated 
with PD, an animal model with hypermetabolism in the early-on could be a better 
PD model for testing diverse therapeutics and the results could be better 
translated to humans. Further characterization is needed for understanding 
possible underlying mechanism and development of a new animal model for unique 
PD endophenotype expressing motoric, cognitive and metabolic symptomatology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
hyperphosphorylation of tau, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. 
Lead (Pb) exposure has been linked to an increased risk of AD and 
neuroinflammation. The purpose of this study is to determine if black soybean 
peptide (BSP1) may reduce neuroinflammation caused by Pb and associated AD-like 
pathology. Pb exposure was given to mouse hippocampus HT22 cells in the presence 
or absence of BSP1, positive control resveratrol (Rsv), or the SIRT1 inhibitor 
EX-527. Our findings suggest that BSP1 downregulates the expression of 
beta-secretase (BACE1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), inhibits tau 
phosphorylation, and reduces Aβ1-42 deposition. In addition, BSP1 effectively 
alleviated Pb-induced neuroinflammation by reducing the phosphorylation of NF-κB 
and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, NLRP3, and 
IL-18). BSP1 provides neuroprotective effect via phosphorylating LKB1 and AMPK, 
inhibiting mTOR signaling, and activating the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. These results 
suggest that BSP1 may be therapeutically beneficial for preventing or treating 
AD by reducing Pb-induced neuroinflammation.

Gene editing strategies to safely and robustly modify the Alzheimer's 
disease-associated APOE4 isoform are still lacking. Prime editing (PE) enables 
the precise introduction of genetic variants with minimal unintended editing and 
without donor templates. However, it requires optimization for each target site 
and has not yet been applied to APOE4 gene editing. Here, we screened PE guide 
RNA (pegRNA) parameters and PE systems for introducing the APOE4 variant and 
applied the optimized PE strategy to generate disease-relevant human induced 
pluripotent stem cell models. We show that introducing a single-nucleotide 
difference required for APOE4 correction inhibits PE activity. To advance 
efficient and robust genome engineering of precise genetic variants, we further 
present a reliable PE enrichment strategy based on diphtheria toxin 
co-selection. Our work provides an optimized and reproducible genome engineering 
pipeline to generate APOE4 disease models and outlines novel strategies to 
accelerate genome editing in cellular disease model generation.

The traditional theory of "one drug, one target, one illness" has come under 
scrutiny owing to the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the 
failure of most of its medications, therefore multi-target directed ligands 
(MTDLs) are prospective therapeutics for AD. In the present study, we 
synthesized novel series of coumarin derivatives and assessed their inhibitory 
actions against hAChE, hBuChE, GSK-3β, tau protein and Aβ aggregation. Compounds 
6c and 6h stood out among the others with their multifunctional profile. With 
IC50 values of 28.88 and 26.03 nM, respectively, compounds 6c and 6h showed 
outstanding activity as hAChE inhibitors and demonstrated good inhibitory 
activity against hBuChE with IC50 values of 103.90 and 90.09 nM along with 
appropriate action against GSK-3β in nanomolar range. Also, both compounds 6c 
and 6h were found to outperform the reported anti-AD donepezil as tau protein 
aggregation and amyloid aggregation (Aβ) inhibitors as well as low cytotoxicity 
on healthy neuroblastoma SHSY5Y and hepatic THLE2 cells. Kinetic analysis and 
docking studies indicated hAChE dual site (mixed) inhibitory effect of compound 
6h. Both compounds 6c and 6h complied with Lipinski's rule of five and were 
virtually able to cross the BBB. All the data suggested that compounds 6c and 6h 
have potential as a multifunctional therapy for AD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
markers of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damage, neurogranin (Ng) and 
neurofilament light chain (NfL), with suicidal ideation in older adults.
METHOD: The sample was obtained from the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies and 
included 316 dementia free individuals (151 women, 165 men, mean age 70.6) who 
underwent extensive psychiatric examinations and lumbar puncture (LP). Suicidal 
ideation was assessed using the Paykel questions.
RESULTS: Past year suicidal ideation (any severity level) was reported by 9 
(2.8%) participants while 58 (18.4%) reported experiencing such ideation during 
their lifetime. High CSF Ng level was associated with lifetime reports of life 
weariness (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.01-4.11, P = 0.048), death wishes (OR 2.26, 95% CI 
1.02-4.98, P = 0.044) and thoughts of taking one's own life (OR 3.17, 95% CI 
1.31-7.65, P = 0.010) in adjusted logistic regression models including 
self-reported lifetime depression as a covariate. The association between high 
CSF Ng level and lifetime suicidal ideation (all severity levels) remained in 
models adjusted for CSF levels of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), T-Tau and P-Tau. No 
relationship was seen between high CSF NfL and suicidal ideation.
CONCLUSION: The association between high CSF Ng level and history of suicidal 
ideation suggests that synaptic dysfunction may be involved in the diathesis of 
passive suicidal ideation. CSF markers of neurodegeneration did not modify these 
findings.

BACKGROUND: Several mechanisms have been proposed for the brain uptake of 
omega-3 fatty acids (n-3), including passive diffusion of the unesterified form 
and the use of Mfsd2a transporter for the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) form. We 
hypothesize that the accumulation of LPC n-3 in the brain is lower in mice 
carrying the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for 
developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease in humans.
OBJECTIVE: Determine whether two or four months of supplementation with LPC n-3 
increases the levels of docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acids 
(EPA) in the frontal cortex of APOE3 and APOE4 mice.
METHODS: APOE3 and APOE4 mice were administered LPC n-3 (9.6 mg DHA + 18.3 mg 
EPA) or sunflower oil (control) by oral gavage for two or four months (n = 5-8 
per genotype, per treatment, and per treatment duration). At the end of the 
treatment period, frontal cortices were collected, and their FA profiles 
analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection.
RESULTS: After two months of gavage with LPC n-3, APOE3 mice showed increased 
levels of EPA in their cortex, but not DHA. In APOE4 mice, neither EPA nor DHA 
levels were significantly affected. After four months of LPC n-3, both APOE3 and 
APOE4 mice exhibited higher EPA levels, while changes in DHA levels were not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: LPC n-3 supplementation increased EPA, but not DHA, levels in the 
frontal cortex of mice in a duration- and APOE genotype-dependent manner. 
Further research is needed to explore the implications for brain health.

Fast Melt Tablet (FMT) is a newer type of orally disintegrating tablet using the 
advantage of cocoa butter that melts at body temperature to achieve fast melting 
effect when the tablet is placed in oral cavity. However, oral disintegrating 
dosage form must have good palatability so that patients can accept it. The 
objective of this study is to taste mask a previously developed FMT containing 
memantine hydrochloride using artificial sweetener namely aspartame and 
acesulfame K and conduct a palatability study. Six formulations were developed 
and each sweetener was used at three level (10mg, 20mg and 30mg) to taste mask 
memantine hydrochloride in FMT. Formulation T7 was selected as the best taste 
masked formulation. Aspartame 30mg is sufficient to cover the bitter taste of 
memantine hydrochloride. A taste masked memantine hydrochloride FMT containing 
30mg of aspartame was successfully developed. This formulation has hardness of 
17.31 (0.18) Newton, 0.51 (0.02) g weight, 6.18 (0.42) mm thickness and in-vitro 
melting time of 31.16 (1.23) seconds. This novel dosage form has the potential 
to be commercialized as a patient friendly dosage form to treat Alzheimer's 
disease.

INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) can enable early detection of brain 
amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology in cognitively unimpaired individuals. However, the 
extent to which common medical conditions affect biomarker performance remains 
unclear.
METHODS: Participants (n = 348) included individuals without cognitive 
impairment. We studied how brain Aβ associated with BBMs (Aβ42/40, 
phosphorylated tau [p-tau] 181 and 217, p-tau217/Aβ42, glial fibrillary acidic 
protein [GFAP], and neurofilament light [NfL]) and optimal BBM thresholds for 
predicting brain Aβ positivity and whether they are obscured by the presence of 
common medical conditions.
RESULTS: Plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau217, and GFAP, but not NfL, were 
significantly associated with brain Aβ. P-tau217/Aβ42 showed the best 
discriminative performance (area under the curve: 0.91). The strength of 
p-tau217-brain Aβ associations were obscured by diabetes and cardiovascular 
conditions.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest BBMs may help detect early Aβ pathology but 
suggest caution in their use due to common medical conditions that could affect 
accuracy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, p-tau217, and GFAP but not NfL showed 
significant associations with brain Aβ. BBMs were more strongly associated with 
the level of brain Aβ in those without diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. 
P-tau217/Aβ42 showed the best performance (AUC = 0.91) in discriminating Aβ 
presence with an optimal cut-off of >1.2, followed by p-tau217 at >0.46 pg/mL, 
with performance slightly improving when excluding participants with 
cardiovascular conditions.

Exerkines mitigating Alzheimer's disease progression by regulating inflammation: 
Focusing on macrophage/microglial NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

Recent research highlights the critical role of inflammation in accelerating 
amyloid beta and phosphorylated tubulin-associated protein tau cascade and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise 
influences AD by modulating inflammatory responses. We conducted a comprehensive 
search across multiple online databases. Our approach focused on previous and 
recent studies exploring the links among inflammation, AD, and the effects of 
exercise, specifically targeting research articles and books published in 
English. We pointed out that inflammation extends from the periphery to the 
central nervous system, facilitated by macrophage/microglial NLRP3 
(nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich-containing family, pyrin 
domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome signaling, which exacerbates classical 
AD mechanisms. Moreover, we provided further insights into the modulation of 
inflammasome signaling through exercise and exerkines, which may contribute to 
mitigating AD development. These insights deepen our understanding of AD 
mechanisms and offer the potential for identifying key therapeutic targets and 
biomarkers crucial for effective disease management and treatment. HIGHLIGHTS: 
Inflammation is potentially linked to the acceleration of classical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis, including the pathways involving amyloid beta and 
phosphorylated tau, mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Inflammation, 
initiated by the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich-containing 
family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway 
within M1-type macrophages/microglia, may contribute to neuroinflammation and AD 
progression. Exercise has the potential to reduce inflammation and the 
development of AD by influencing NLRP3 inflammasome signaling via exerkines.

BACKGROUND: The diagnostic and prognostic performance of the novel fluid 
biomarkers brain-derived tau (BD-tau) and phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) in 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is not defined.
METHODS: We measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma BD-tau, p-tau217, 
p-tau181, total tau (t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), and 14-3-3 in 100 CJD 
patients, 100 with non-prion rapidly progressive dementia (np-RPD), 92 with mild 
cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD-MCI), and 55 healthy 
controls (HC).
RESULTS: Plasma BD-tau performed comparably to plasma t-tau but had lower 
performance than CSF t-tau (p < 0.001) and 14-3-3 (p = 0.014) in CJD versus 
np-RPD differential diagnosis. Plasma BD-tau diagnostic accuracy increased when 
ratioed to plasma p-tau217, matching CSF 14-3-3. Plasma BD-tau levels were 
associated with survival (p < 0.001), outperforming t-tau and NfL.
DISCUSSION: Plasma BD-tau is a valuable marker for CJD prognostication. In the 
clinical setting, the plasma BD-tau/p-tau217 ratio provides an accurate, fast 
marker supporting the clinical diagnosis of CJD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The increase of plasma BD-tau levels parallels that of CSF t-tau in 
CJD. CSF p-tau217 levels are significantly increased in CJD, reflecting a 
prion-specific secondary tauopathy. Plasma p-tau217 shows a distinct profile 
than CSF p-tau217 in CJD. Plasma BD-tau/p-tau217 ratio is as accurate as CSF 
14-3-3 in distinguishing CJD from np-RPDs, including AD. BD-tau represents a 
valuable blood-based biomarker for CJD prognostication.

INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle 
Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) is evaluating lifestyle interventions 
in older adults at risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Here we characterize 
the baseline data set of the POINTER Imaging ancillary study.
METHODS: Participants underwent health and cognitive assessments and 
neuroimaging with multimodal positron emission tomography (PET) (beta-amyloid 
[Aβ] and tau) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Framingham risk score (FRS) 
was used to quantify cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
RESULTS: A total of 1052 participants (31% from underrepresented ethnoracial 
groups) were enrolled. Compared to Aβ-, Aβ+ (29%) participants were older, had 
higher apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriage rate and white matter hyperintensity 
volume, and greater temporal tau. FRS was related to MRI measures, but not AD 
biomarkers. FRS and tau had independent effects on cognition.
DISCUSSION: In this heterogenous, at-risk cohort, CVD risk was related to more 
abnormal brain structure and poorer cognition, representing a putative non-AD 
(Alzheimer's disease) pathway to brain injury and cognitive decline.
HIGHLIGHTS: ·The U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle 
Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) cohort is enriched for cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and poor lifestyle ·POINTER Imaging collected multimodal 
neuroimaging data in this unique, at-risk cohort ·Amyloid burden was related to 
age, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriage, and measures of disease progression 
·Associations between amyloid and tau, and tau and cognition, were relatively 
weak ·CVD risk and tau pathology were independently related to memory.

INTRODUCTION: High microglial heterogeneities hinder the development of 
microglia-targeted treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We integrated 0.7 million single-nuclei RNA-sequencing transcriptomes 
from human brains using a variational autoencoder. We predicted AD-relevant 
microglial subtype-specific transition networks for disease-associated microglia 
(DAM), tau microglia, and neuroinflammation-like microglia (NIM). We prioritized 
drugs by specifically targeting microglia-specific transition networks and 
validated drugs using two independent real-world patient databases.
RESULTS: We identified putative AD molecular drivers (e.g., SYK, CTSB, and 
INPP5D) in transition networks of DAM and NIM. Via specifically targeting NIM, 
we identified that usage of ketorolac was associated with reduced AD incidence 
in both MarketScan (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89) and INSIGHT (HR = 0.83) Clinical 
Research Network databases, mechanistically supported by ketorolac-treated 
transcriptomic data from AD patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
microglia.
DISCUSSION: This study offers insights into the pathobiology of AD-relevant 
microglial subtypes and identifies ketorolac as a potential anti-inflammatory 
treatment for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: An integrative analysis of ≈ 0.7 million single-nuclei 
RNA-sequencing transcriptomes from human brains identified Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-relevant microglia subtypes. Network-based analysis identified putative 
molecular drivers (e.g., SYK, CTSB, INPP5D) of transition networks between 
disease-associated microglia (DAM) and neuroinflammation-like microglia (NIM). 
Via network-based prediction and population-based validation, we identified that 
usage of ketorolac (a US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-inflammatory 
medicine) was associated with reduced AD incidence in two independent patient 
databases. Mechanistic observation showed that ketorolac treatment downregulated 
the Type-I interferon signaling in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
microglia, mechanistically supporting its protective effects in real-world 
patient databases.

An incurable neurogenerative illness, Alzheimer's disease, is the cause of most 
global health, medical, and social disasters. The two main symptoms are 
cognitive impairment and neuronal loss. Current medications that target tau 
protein tangles and Aβ plaques are not very effective because they only slow the 
symptoms of AD and do not repair damaged cells. Stem cell-based treatments, 
however, present an alternative strategy in the treatment of AD. They have the 
capacity to divide into specialized adult cells, have self-renewal abilities, 
and multiplication. Stem cells can now be employed as a donor source for cell 
therapy due to developments in stem cell technology. This review covers 
preclinical and clinical updates on studies based on targeting the tau protein 
tangles and Aβ plaque, as well as four types of stem cells employed in AD 
treatment. The review also outlines the two basic pathologic aspects, tau 
protein tangles and Aβ plaques, of AD.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of microglia triggers the release of 
neuroinflammatory molecules, contributing to the progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting these neuroinflammatory molecules could 
serve as a potential therapeutic strategy. Given the evidence supporting the 
immune-boosting properties of curcumin (Curc) and the protective effects of 
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) in the central nervous system (CNS) related to 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), this study aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory 
effects of these compounds on primary rat microglial cells, which are crucial in 
the response to neuroinflammation. This in vitro study investigated the effects 
of Curc, MPL, and their coadministration (Curc + MPL) on inflammatory cytokine 
levels in activated microglial cells. Primary microglial cells were isolated 
from 1-day-old rats and treated with various concentrations of Curc, MPL, and 
Curc + MPL prior to LPS stimulation. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT 
assay, followed by the Griess assay to evaluate nitric oxide (NO) production. 
The levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as the gene expression 
of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), were analyzed via 
real-time PCR. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was 
employed to quantify the protein levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. Our findings 
demonstrate that Curc and MPL possess antineuroinflammatory properties in 
LPS-stimulated microglial cells. Notably, the coadministration of Curc and MPL 
(Curc + MPL) significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. Furthermore, Curc + MPL suppressed the 
expression of iNOS and COX-2. These results strongly suggest that Curc + MPL is 
a promising neuroprotective agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
disorders by mitigating neuroinflammatory responses.

Interactions between antidiabetes medications and heart-brain axis.

Ong LT(1), Sia CH.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cardiology, National University Heart Centre, Singapore.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The heart - brain axis (HBA) is the physiological 
interactions between the cardiovascular and nervous systems through autonomic 
nerves, hormones, and cytokines. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus have 
an increased risk of the cardiovascular and neurological diseases. However, 
recent evidence demonstrated that different antidiabetic drugs may delay 
cognitive impairment and improve cardiovascular outcomes. This review examines 
the impact of antidiabetic drugs on the HBA in patients with diabetes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Metformin improves the cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes 
through adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation. 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors reduce inflammation, oxidative stress 
by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome thereby reducing the incidence of heart 
failure and formation of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. 
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors exhibit neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's 
disease by reducing amyloid-beta and tau pathology and inflammation but may 
exacerbate heart failure risk due to increased sympathetic activity and 
prolonged β-adrenergic stimulation. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
exhibit neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases by 
reducing neuroinflammation, but may increase sympathetic activity, potentially 
elevating heart rate and blood pressure, despite their cardioprotective 
benefits.
SUMMARY: Antidiabetes medications have the potential to improve cardiovascular 
and cognitive outcomes; however, additional studies are required to substantiate 
these effects.

BACKGROUND: A blood-based biomarker that accurately reflects neuronal injury in 
acute ischemic stroke could be an easily accessible and cost-effective 
complement to clinical and radiological evaluation. Here, we investigate whether 
plasma levels of the novel biomarker brain-derived tau (BD-tau) reflect cerebral 
infarct volumes and whether BD-tau can improve clinical outcome prediction.
METHODS: The present study included 713 consecutive cases from two different 
hospital-based cohorts, the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke 
(SAHLSIS) and SAHLSIS phase 2 (SAHLSIS2). Acute stroke severity was determined 
by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale converted to the National Institutes of Health 
stroke scale (NIHSS) in SAHLSIS and by the NIHSS in SAHLSIS2. All participants 
were assessed for functional outcome 3 months after stroke by the modified 
Rankin Scale, and 254 participants in SAHLSIS had quantitative neuroimaging 
available.
FINDINGS: Plasma BD-tau concentrations and cerebral infarct volumes were highly 
correlated (ρ 0.72, p < 0.001). BD-tau improved the prognostic accuracy of 
suffering an unfavorable outcome over age and stroke severity in the whole 
cohort. However, the gain in predictive power was dependent on stroke severity 
and infarct location. The largest improvement was observed for mild ischemic 
strokes (NIHSS <5; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73 for age + NIHSS versus 
AUC = 0.84 with addition of BD-tau; DeLong p 0.02), posterior circulation stroke 
(AUC = 0.75 vs. AUC = 0.84; DeLong p 0.06) and more specifically for infarcts in 
the brainstem/cerebellum (AUC = 0.74 vs. 0.87; DeLong p 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Plasma BD-tau can provide information on the extent of acute 
neuronal damage in ischemic stroke and adds prognostic value for outcome, 
especially for mild and posterior circulation strokes.

Lecanemab, an antibody drug targeting amyloid-β, has been approved to treat 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States and Japan recently. However, there 
are several concerns about Lecanemab, such as its minimum biological effects, 
possible side effects, and its economic burden. On the other hand, 
non-pharmacological approach without major side effects has a potential to 
alleviate the symptoms of AD by improving cognitive reserve, which is 
individual's resilience to AD pathology. It is important to compare the benefits 
and risks of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, especially in

BACKGROUND: Caregivers of people living with dementia (PLWD) often experience 
burden based on their care recipients' symptoms of wandering, disorientation, 
and agitation.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the utilization and perceived value of technology-based 
solutions for caregiving among caregivers of PLWD.
METHODS: In collaboration with three Texas sites, PLWD and family caregiver 
dyads were recruited from clinical and community sites to assess the feasibility 
of a caregiving technology. PLWDs were asked to wear a GPS-based wearable 
device, which was paired with caregivers' smartphone application, that enabled 
location monitoring and was equipped with call functions. After three months, 
researchers called caregivers to ask about their utilization of the "system" 
(i.e., wearable paired with smartphone application) and the perceived value of 
this technology. Forty-one caregivers completed follow-up telephone interviews.
RESULTS: About 70% of caregivers reported their care recipient wore the wearable 
device daily, and 39.1% used the smartphone application daily. Approximately 31% 
of caregivers reported daily use of the tracking feature, 30.8% reported daily 
use of the "safe zone" feature (i.e., geo-fencing), and 17.1% reported daily use 
of the two-way calling feature. About 39% of caregivers were extremely satisfied 
with the "system," 43.6% found it extremely easy to use, and 46.2% found it 
extremely useful for caregiving. On average, caregivers with higher baseline 
Zarit Burden Interview scores found the "system" to be more useful with their 
caregiving (f = 5.97, p = 0.006) and were more satisfied with the "system" 
(f = 3.75, p = 0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest caregiver burden may drive the perceived 
usefulness of, and satisfaction with, technology-based solutions.

Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.

The prevalence and global health burden of dementia including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is rising, while patients living in remote and underserved areas 
face significant challenges in reaching specialized care. Telemedicine offers a 
valuable solution in bridging this widening gap, by providing equal and timely 
access to tertiary-specialized centers. Accumulating evidence highlights that 
most parts of the remote neuropsychological and neurological evaluation are 
feasible, with patients, healthcare professionals and caregivers being generally 
satisfied with this means of care. Herein, we provide an updated overview of the 
available evidence on the use of telemedicine for patients with cognitive 
disorders, focusing on the different applications and settings, the remote, 
video-based neurological and neuropsychological assessment, current 
recommendations, non-pharmacological interventions, as well as legal and ethical 
considerations. Based on the literature review and our three-year experience in 
the "Specialized Outpatient Clinic of Memory, Dementia and Parkinson's disease 
through the National Telemedicine Network" in the Aiginition University Hospital 
of Athens, we propose a brief guide for assessing patients with cognitive 
impairment via telemedicine and suggest future research directions for the more 
effective and appropriate use of telemedicine in dementia assessment and care.

BACKGROUND: Depression in pregnancy can increase vulnerability for psychiatric 
disorders in the offspring, likely via the transfer of heightened maternal 
cortisol and cytokines to the in-utero environment. However, the precise 
cellular and molecular mechanisms, are largely unclear. Animal studies can 
represent this complex pathophysiology at a systemic level but are expensive and 
ethically challenging. While simpler, in vitro models offer high-throughput 
opportunities. Therefore, this systematic review integrates findings of in vitro 
models relevant to depression in pregnancy, to generate novel hypotheses and 
targets for intervention.
METHODS: The systematic analysis covered studies investigating glucocorticoid or 
cytokine challenges on placental or foetal neural progenitor cells (NPCs), with 
or without co-treatment with sex hormones.
RESULTS: Of the 50 included studies, 11 used placental cells and 39 NPCs; 
surprisingly, only one used a combination of oestrogen and cortisol, and no 
study combined placental cells and NPCs. In placental cells, cortisol or 
cytokines decreased nutrient transporter expression and steroidogenic enzyme 
activity, and increased cytokine production. NPCs exhibited decreases in 
proliferation and differentiation, via specific molecular pathways, namely, 
inhibition of hedgehog signalling and activation of kynurenine pathway. In these 
cells, studies also highlighted epigenetic priming of stress and inflammatory 
pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggest that stress and inflammation not only 
detrimentally impact placental regulation of nutrients and hormones to the 
foetus, but also activate downstream pathways through increased inflammation in 
the placenta, ultimately eliciting adverse effects on foetal neurogenesis. 
Future research should investigate how sex hormones regulate these mechanisms, 
with the aim of developing targeted therapeutic approaches for depression in 
pregnancy.

The role of microglia in the amyloid cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
debated due to conflicting findings. Using a genetic and a pharmacological 
approach we demonstrate that depletion of microglia before amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque 
deposition, leads to a reduction in plaque numbers and neuritic dystrophy, 
confirming their role in plaque initiation. Transplanting human microglia 
restores Aβ plaque formation. While microglia depletion reduces insoluble Aβ 
levels, soluble Aβ concentrations stay consistent, challenging the view that 
microglia clear Aβ. In later stages, microglial depletion decreases plaque 
compaction and increases neuritic dystrophy, suggesting a protective role. Human 
microglia with the TREM2R47H/R47H mutation exacerbate plaque pathology, 
emphasizing the importance of non-reactive microglia in the initiation of the 
amyloid cascade. Adaptive immune depletion (Rag2-/-) does not affect microglia's 
impact on plaque formation. These findings clarify conflicting reports, 
identifying microglia as key drivers of amyloid pathology, and raise questions 
about optimal therapeutic strategies for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a formidable challenge in the field of 
neurodegenerative disorders, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. 
Nanomedicine, leveraging nanomaterials, has emerged as a promising avenue for AD 
treatment, with a key emphasis on overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to 
enhance drug delivery efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive analysis 
of recent advancements in the application of nanomaterials for AD therapy, 
highlighting their unique properties and functions. The blood-brain barrier, a 
complex physiological barrier, poses a significant hurdle for traditional drug 
delivery to the brain. Nanomedicine addresses this challenge by utilizing 
various nanomaterials such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and metal 
nanoparticles. These nanocarriers enable improved drug bioavailability, 
sustained release, and targeted delivery to specific brain regions affected by 
AD pathology. The review discusses the diverse range of nanomaterials employed 
in AD treatment, exploring their capacity to encapsulate therapeutic agents, 
modulate drug release kinetics, and enhance drug stability. Additionally, the 
multifunctionality of nanomaterials allows for simultaneous imaging and therapy, 
facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Key aspects covered include the 
interaction of nanomaterials with Aβ aggregates, the role of antioxidants in 
mitigating oxidative stress, and the potential of nanomedicine in alleviating 
neuroinflammation associated with AD. Furthermore, the safety, biocompatibility, 
and toxicity profiles of various nanomaterials are scrutinized to ensure their 
clinical applicability. In conclusion, this review underscores the pivotal role 
of nanomedicine and nanomaterials in revolutionizing AD treatment strategies. By 
specifically addressing BBB challenges, these innovative approaches offer new 
avenues for targeted drug delivery and improved therapeutic outcomes in the 
complex landscape of Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by 
cognitive deterioration and changes in behavior. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
which hydrolyzes acetylcholine, is a key drug target for treating AD. This 
research aimed to identify new AChE inhibitors using the IMPPAT database. We 
used known drugs as a basis to search for similar chemicals in the IMPPAT 
database and created a library of 127 plant-based compounds. Initial screening 
of these compounds was performed using molecular docking, followed by an 
analysis of their drug-likeness and ADMET properties. Compounds with favorable 
properties underwent density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess 
their electronic properties such as HOMO-LUMO gap, electron density, and 
molecular orbital distribution. These descriptors provided insights into each 
compound's reactivity, stability, and binding potential with AChE. Promising 
candidates were further evaluated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 
over 100 ns and MMPBSA analysis for the last 30 ns. Two compounds, Biflavanone 
(IMPHY013027) with a binding free energy of - 130.394 kcal/mol and Calomelanol J 
(IMPHY007737) with - 107.908 kcal/mol, demonstrated strong binding affinities 
compared to the reference molecule HOR, which has a binding free energy of 
- 105.132 kcal/mol. These compounds exhibited promising drug-ability profiles in 
both molecular docking and MD simulations, indicating their potential as novel 
AChE inhibitors for AD treatment. However, further experimental validation is 
necessary to verify their effectiveness and safety.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with memory and cognitive impairment 
caused by progressive degeneration of neurons. The events leading to neuronal 
death are associated with the accumulation of aggregating proteins in neurons 
and glia of the affected brain regions, in particular extracellular deposition 
of amyloid plaques and intracellular formation of tau neurofibrillary tangles. 
Moreover, the accumulation of pathological tau proteoforms in the brain 
concurring with disease progression is a key feature of multiple 
neurodegenerative diseases, called tauopathies, like frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD) where autosomal dominant mutations in the tau encoding MAPT gene provide 
clear evidence of a causal role for tau dysfunction. Observations from disease 
models, post-mortem histology, and clinical evidence have demonstrated that 
pathological tau undergoes abnormal post-translational modifications, 
misfolding, oligomerization, changes in solubility, mislocalization, and 
intercellular spreading. Despite extensive research, there are few 
disease-modifying or preventative therapeutics for AD and none for other 
tauopathies. Challenges faced in tauopathy drug development include an 
insufficient understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of tau proteoforms, limited 
specificity of agents tested, and inadequate levels of brain exposure, 
altogether underscoring the need for innovative therapeutic modalities. In 
recent years, the development of experimental therapeutic modalities, such as 
targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies, has shown significant and 
promising potential to promote the degradation of disease-causing proteins, 
thereby reducing accumulation and aggregation. Here, we review all modalities of 
TPD that have been developed to target tau in the context of AD and FTD, as well 
as other approaches that with innovation could be adapted for tau-specific TPD.

Naringenin, a flavonoid with potent antioxidant properties, faces low 
bioavailability, limiting its clinical application in Alzheimer's disease. This 
study developed naringenin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (NAR-CNPs) for 
nose-to-brain delivery using the ionic gelation method. The NAR-CNPs exhibited 
an average particle size of 112.35 ± 1.55 nm, zeta potential of 15.36 ± 2.05 mV, 
and entrapment efficiency of 69.49 ± 1.88 %, with a sustained release profile 
(65.80 % over 8 h). Ex vivo permeation studies showed a 1.91-fold higher 
steady-state flux for NAR-CNPs compared to naringenin suspension, indicating 
enhanced brain penetration. The NAR-CNPs were safe for goat nasal mucosa and 
improved cognitive function in scopolamine-induced demented mice, whereas 
significantly reducing acetylcholinesterase activity (p < 0.001) and increasing 
antioxidant enzyme activities in the brain of experimental mice. Concurrently, 
the level of malondialdehyde was decreased in the brain, indicating reduced 
lipid peroxidation. Histopathological analysis showed a significant increase in 
neuronal count in NAR-CNPs treated animals compared to control group. These 
findings suggest that intranasally administered NAR-CNPs hold promise for 
treating cognitive impairment, though further studies are needed for clinical 
translation.

Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative pathology, is characterized 
by the accumulation of Amyloid-β plaques in the brain. Lecanemab (BAN2401), a 
humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, binds with high affinity to Amyloid-β 
protofibrils. It is the first monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer's disease to 
receive full FDA approval. This systematic review, conducted meticulously, 
examines the current use and safety of Lecanemab in treating Alzheimer's 
disease. We screened literature from databases such as PubMed Central, PubMed 
(MedLine), ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Wolters Kluwer for 
randomized controlled trials testing Lecanemab for cognitive decline in patients 
with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Outcomes measured 
included CDR-SB, ADCOMS, ADAS-Cog, and Amyloid burden on PET in centiloids. 
Likewise, reports were analyzed for adverse events associated with ARIA-A and 
ARIA-H. Five papers were included in the systematic review and three in the 
meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that Lecanemab slowed the progression of 
cognitive impairment as measured by CDR-SB, ADCOMS, and ADASCog, and 
significantly reduced Amyloid burden on PET in centiloids. However, Lecanemab 
was associated with an increased risk of ARIA-E and ARIA-H. Lecanemab has 
demonstrated efficacy in slowing cognitive impairment progression in Alzheimer's 
disease as measured by ADCOMS, ADAS-Cog, and CDR-SB. However, it is associated 
with an increased risk of ARIA-E and ARIA-H, particularly in ApoE4 carriers.

PURPOSE: We studied the promising Alzheimer biomarker plasma tau phosphorylated 
at threonine 231 (p-tau231) in a cohort of cardiac arrest patients who survived 
to intensive care to predict long-term neurological outcomes. We also compared 
it to total tau (t-tau), which has demonstrated predictive abilities of 
neurological outcome post-cardiac arrest.
METHODS: This observational multicentre cohort study included 425 patients 
admitted to intensive care after cardiac arrest. Plasma p-tau231 was 
retrospectively analysed at admission, 12 and 48 h after cardiac arrest. The 
association of the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) with p-tau231 was 
analysed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). CPC was modelled using 
multivariate ordinal logistic regression, and the biomarkers' prognostic 
performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Increasing p-tau231 levels were significantly associated with worse CPC 
(p < 0.001). P-tau231 showed moderate prognostic abilities (AUC: 0.69 on 
admission, 0.72 at 12 h, and 0.71 at 48 h) for all patients but did not improve 
neurological prognostication after adjusting for clinical covariates. Elevated 
levels of t-tau were significantly associated with a worse outcome at all time 
points (p < 0.001). T-tau significantly improved neurological prognosis at 48 h 
after adjusting for covariates (AUC: 0.95, 95 % CI 0.93-0.98, p < 0.001) 
compared to the clinical covariate reference model (AUC: 0.88, 95 % CI 
0.84-0.93).
CONCLUSIONS: Although p-tau231 showed moderate neurological prognostic ability, 
t-tau was a stronger predictor, particularly at 48 h, even after adjusting for 
clinical covariates.

Clinical biomarkers are crucial for diagnosing and predicting outcomes in 
patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we performed an 
unbiased analysis of plasma proteins in acute TBI patients using bead-based 
multiplex assays and identified a strong positive correlation between LCN2 and 
IL-6 levels. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that LCN2 and IL-6 are 
closely related circulating biomarkers for TBI. Our previous and current studies 
demonstrate that the expression of LCN2, IL-6, and its receptors is upregulated 
in patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, in mouse models of traumatic 
and ischemic injury, and in an in vitro scratch injury model. Lcn2-deficiency 
reduced the injury-induced expression of IL-6 and its receptors in both animal 
and scratch injury models. These results suggest an augmented LCN2-dependent 
IL-6 signaling in the injured brain. As both LCN2 and IL-6 are secreted 
proinflammatory mediators, we further explored the possibility of 
cross-regulation between LCN2 and IL-6. In cultured glial cells, treatment with 
recombinant LCN2 protein enhanced the microglial expression of IL-6, while IL-6 
protein treatment increased astrocytic LCN2 expression. Moreover, IL-6 
expression and release were elevated in LCN2-overexpressing transgenic mice. 
Mechanistically, IL-6 enhanced astrocytic LCN2 expression through STAT3 
signaling, while LCN2 upregulated microglial IL-6 expression through the NF-κB 
pathway. Taken together, our results suggest an important role of the LCN2-IL-6 
axis in amplifying neuroinflammation through a positive feedback loop in 
secondary brain injury conditions. Finally, this study implies the utility of 
LCN2 and IL-6 as closely related biomarkers for TBI diagnosis and prognosis.

Behavioral testing is an essential tool for evaluating cognitive function and 
dysfunction in preclinical research models. This is of special importance in the 
study of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the 
reproducibility of classic behavioral assays is frequently compromised by 
interstudy variation, leading to ambiguous conclusions about the behavioral 
markers characterizing the disease. Here, we identify age- and genotype-driven 
differences between 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic control mice using a low-cost, 
highly customizable behavioral assay that requires little human intervention. 
Through behavioral phenotyping combining both supervised and unsupervised 
behavioral classification methods, we are able to validate the preventative 
effects of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A in a rodent model of Alzheimer's 
disease, as well as the partially ameliorating effects of candidate drugs 
nebivolol and cabozantinib.

Huperzine A is an alkaloid featuring a bicyclo [3.3.1] nonane scaffold with an 
integrated piperidine ring, which was firstly isolated from Huperzia selago in 
1960. As a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, it was clinically approved 
in China for treatment of Alzheimer's disease in 1996. Although huperzine A 
shows therapeutic potential, it is often associated with adverse events, such as 
dizziness, nausea, and digestive disorders. To enhance the efficacy and 
therapeutic index of huperzine A, many structural modification efforts have been 
undertaken. This review comprehensively summarizes the structural modification 
investigations on huperzine A conducted over the past three decades, and the 
structure-activity relationships are also discussed. The insights from this 
review are expected to inspire more effective modification strategies in the 
future.

A novel Schiff base with imine/amine donors, 
5-((3,3-diphenylalilidene)amino)pyrimidine-4-amine (L), and its new Platinum(II) 
and Ruthenium(II) complexes (I and II) were synthesized and characterized using 
FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analyses. The ability of 
these complexes to inhibit amyloid beta (Aβ1-42) aggregation was evaluated using 
the human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The complexes effectively inhibited 
Aβ1-42 aggregation at a 1:1 M ratio. Both complexes increased cell viability up 
to 80 % at concentrations of 10 μM. At this concentration, the cell viability 
value found by Aβ1-42 aggregation is around 65 %. Aggregation kinetics were 
fluorometrically monitored using Thioflavin T. These findings were further 
supported by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. 
In addition, the interaction of the complexes with Aβ1-16 was investigated using 
MALDI-TOF/MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy. All findings showed that Aβ1-42 in both 
complexes is active in the inhibition of amyloid aggregation.

The media is a key site for developing and communicating public understanding of 
Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause of dementia, and a 
condition that is prominent in public perceptions of ageing and cognitive 
decline. Novel disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are the first innovation in 
Alzheimer's disease treatment for two decades, and have the potential to change 
how society thinks about Alzheimer's disease. This study investigates 
representation of risks and uncertainties of DMTs in articles published within 
the five highest circulation US newspapers between November 2020 and May 2024. 
This was a period of focused media attention on DMTs in the US, including 
reporting on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and approval processes 
and debates over public funding of these treatments through the Medicare 
program. The analysis finds that the media associated risks with the relative 
efficacy of the medications in comparison to the costs of these treatments. We 
further find that media representations highlight institutional challenges for 
the FDA in managing these uncertainties, within a situation characterized by 
expert contestation of the evidentiary basis for DMTs and patient hope for the 
promise that DMTs hold.

Plasma membrane protein degradation and recycling are regulated by the 
endolysosomal system, wherein endocytic vesicles bud from the plasma membrane 
into the cytoplasm and mature into endosomes and then degradative lysosomes. As 
such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the 
abundance of proteins on the cell surface and influencing cellular identity and 
function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system 
for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The 
importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of 
risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, 
ranging from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, our understanding 
of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in 
part due to technical limitations. Here, we develop a toolkit for capturing 
EEA1-positive endosomes (termed Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (termed 
Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrate its 
utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for stem cells and 
cortical-like iNeurons, and profiling endosomes in response to 
potassium-mediated neuronal depolarization. Through global profiling of 
endocytic cargo, we identify hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including 
neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted 
SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling 
reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled 
recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate 
mechanistic interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in 
neurodegenerative disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Researchers have conducted 
numerous studies to find accurate biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and develop 
more effective treatments. The main pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid 
beta and Tau proteins. Other biomarkers, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, can 
also be helpful in early AD diagnosis. To diagnose and treat AD promptly, it is 
essential to accurately measure the concentration of biomarkers in the 
cerebrospinal fluid or blood. However, due to the low concentrations of these 
biomarkers in the body, highly sensitive analytical techniques are required. To 
date, sensors have become increasingly important due to their high sensitivity, 
swift detection, and adaptable manipulation features. These qualities make them 
an excellent substitute for conventional instruments. Nanomaterials are commonly 
employed in sensors to amplify signals and improve sensitivity. This review 
paper summarized the integration of nanomaterials in optical sensor systems, 
including colorimetric, fluorescent, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering 
sensors for AD biomarkers detection.

The function and mechanism of Cyclophilin A (CypA) in modulating gene expression 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. This multifunctional 
protein is found to be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals 
at risk for AD. The cytotoxic effects of CypA, including both wild-type and the 
mutant R55A, were assessed using the MTT assay. Prior to this evaluation, the 
purified recombinant protein was validated through enzymatic activity assays and 
western blot analysis. Following treatment with CypA and transient transfection 
using the CypA construct, real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were 
conducted to analyze the expression of factors involved in various signaling 
pathways, with an emphasis on inflammation, cell death, and intercellular 
communication. The findings indicate that CypA has a significant impact on the 
gene expression of factors associated with inflammation and the progression of 
AD in SH-SY5Y cells. It can be concluded that CypA is capable of regulating gene 
expression in SH-SY5Y cells, either in a manner dependent on or independent of 
its enzymatic activity. Additionally, the influence of this multifunctional 
protein on gene expression is contingent upon the specific site of action, as 
well as the dosage and duration of exposure to the cells.

The Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) was created by the 
Canadian federal government through its health research funding agency, the 
Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), in 2014, as a response to the G7 
initiative to fight dementia. Two five-year funding cycles (2014-2019; 
2019-2024) have occurred following peer review, and a third cycle (Phase 3) has 
just begun. A unique construct was mandated, consisting of 20 national teams in 
Phase I and 19 teams in Phase II (with research topics spanning from basic to 
clinical science to health resource systems) along with cross-cutting programs 
to support them. Responding to the needs of researchers within the CCNA teams, a 
unique sample of 1173 deeply phenotyped patients with various forms of dementia 
was accrued and studied over eight years (COMPASS-ND). In the second phase of 
funding (2019-2024), a national dementia prevention program (CAN-THUMBS UP) was 
set up. In a short time, this prevention program became a member of the World 
Wide FINGERS prevention consortium. In this article, the challenges, successes, 
and impacts of CCNA in Canada and internationally are discussed. Short-term 
deliverables have occurred, along with considerable promise of impacts in the 
longer term. The creation of synergy, networking, capacity building, engagement 
of people with lived experience, and economies of scale have contributed to the 
considerable success of CCNA by all measures. CCNA is evidence that an organized 
"centrally-organized" approach to dementia research can catalyze important 
progress nationally and yield significant and measurable results.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects millions of 
people worldwide and its cause is very complicated. Besides the classical 
amyloid cascade hypothesis, oxidative stress, metal ion imbalance, cellular 
senescence and neuroinflammation are also considered crucial triggers of AD. 
Therefore, therapeutic strategies other than inhibiting Aβ deposition are very 
promising. As a crucial innate immune pathway, the abnormal activation of the 
cGAS-STING pathway in AD has attracted much attention and become a promising 
target for AD treatment. Here, we identify a highly conserved and stable 
G-quadruplex (G4) in the STING promoter region, and further verify its function 
in transcriptional inhibition of STING by using CRISPR technology to precisely 
target STING G4. Intriguingly, down-regulation of STING expression can alleviate 
cellular senescence and restore the Aβ phagocytic capacity of microglia. Our 
results highlight the compelling therapeutic potential of STING promoter G4 for 
regulation of the abnormal activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in AD. Different 
from the existing therapeutic strategies for AD, this work provides an 
alternative way of targeting the functional gene secondary structure, such as 
the STING promoter region, which may promote the design and synthesis of drug 
candidates for AD.

Hyperphosphorylated tau targeting human serum albumin Fusion protein as 
therapeutics for Alzheimer's diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are composed of hyperphosphorylated 
forms of microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau), which is responsible for 
neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampal region has been a 
major focus of AD research because the deposits of phosphorylated tau protein in 
these regions are correlated with early memory deficits. Despite extensive 
studies, therapeutic strategies to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation and NFTs 
deposition remain unclear. AL04, a recently developed recombinant fusion protein 
comprising Cystatin C, human serum albumin, and a novel blood brain barrier 
(BBB) penetrating peptide, is currently under investigation. Previous studies 
have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing amyloid beta plaques in AD mouse 
model.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of AL04 on lowering 
hyperphosphorylated tau and NFTs in JNPL3 mouse model harboring human tau-P301L 
mutation. 3-month-old female mice intraperitoneally received AL04 (5 mg/kg) or 
PBS treatment every other week for 24 weeks. We used confocal microscopy and 
western blot to visualize and analyze changes in hyperphosphorylated tau 
Ser202/Thr205 labeled with AT8 antibody in the brain.
RESULTS: We found that the AL04 treatment decreases hyperphosphorylated tau at 
PP2A-sensitive epitope Ser202/Thr205 in the hippocampus of the brain. In the 
brain lysates of AL04 treated mice, we observed the reduction of I2PP2A, 
inhibitor of PP2A, and the induction of autophagy receptor proteins such as 
SQSTM-1/p62 and OPTN.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that AL04 can be used as an AD 
prophylactic/therapeutic agent as it lowers the hyperphosphorylated tau by 
downregulating I2PP2A. We also propose that AL04 can induce the degradation of 
hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates through the upregulation of the autophagy 
pathway.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is crucial for the breakdown of monoamine 
neurotransmitters, making it a promising target for treating neurodegenerative 
disorders, such as depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In 
this study, we investigated the selective inhibitory activity of chromone-based 
compounds against MAO-A and MAO-B for neurodegenerative disease treatment. In 
literary sources, thirty chromone derivatives have been identified as potential 
ligands for MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors. We utilized molecular docking to 
evaluate how the most active compound interacted with the targeted MAO-A and 
MAO-B. Compound 2 g, the most active for MAO-A, demonstrated a lower CDOCKER 
energy compared to the co-crystallized ligand. Meanwhile, compound 2f, the most 
active for MAO-B, showed a CDOCKER energy similar to the co-crystallized ligand 
and exhibited similar binding patterns. Furthermore, we constructed a 
quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict the 
properties and estimate IC50 values for 30 chromone derivatives functioning as 
MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors. The model predictions were validated against 
experimental measurements. Our 2D QSAR model demonstrated robustness, with a 
statistically significant non-cross-validated coefficient (r2 < 0.9), 
cross-validated correlation coefficient (q2 < 0.6), and predictive squared 
correlation coefficient (r2pred < 0.8). Additionally, MD simulations confirmed 
the stable binding of compounds 2 g and 2f with MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively, 
displaying substantial binding energy. The most effective pharmacophore model 
identified key features, such as hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrophobic 
interactions, that contribute significantly to inhibitory potency. This study 
offers valuable insight into the selection of compounds with improved 
selectivity for MAO inhibition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and largely incurable 
neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is 
characterised by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles in the brain. It is commenced by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) by β-secretase, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1; 
also called Asp2, memapsin 2). Therefore, BACE1 is a prime target for developing 
therapeutics against AD. In this study, we have identified a small molecule that 
potentially inhibits the activity of BACE1 by interacting with the active site 
residues. Also, the flap region seems to be involved in enhancing the stability 
of the small molecule at the active site. We have used Umibecestat (CNP-520) as 
a positive control. Our in silico results show that the identified molecule has 
a much better orientation at the active site of BACE1 than Umibecestat and 
inhibits by blocking the active site and modulating flap dynamics. We have 
utilised virtual high-throughput screening assay, ADME profiling, and 
blood-brain-barrier crossing ability to narrow down potential leads. The two 
shortlisted molecules were then subjected to atomistic molecular dynamics 
simulations study. Overall, our study proposes a much better inhibitor and a 
rational molecule for lead development against AD.

Plain Language Summary: Knowledge-based drug designing against BACE1 receptor 
involved in Alzheimer’s disease.Identified hits were compared with positive 
control Umibecestat also Known as CNP520.Identified molecules show enhanced 
inhibitory effects than positive control confirmed by dynamics and energy 
profiling.Identified top hit blocks active site and involves flap region to 
acquire a ‘closed flap’ conformation thus inhibiting via the dual mechanism.

Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disease, but the initiation 
mechanisms are unclear. Although antipsychotics are effective against positive 
symptoms, therapeutic interventions for negative symptoms are limited due to the 
lack of pathophysiological mechanisms. Here we identify synaptotagmin-11 (Syt11) 
as a potential genetic risk factor and dopamine over-transmission as a mechanism 
in the development of schizophrenia. Syt11 expression is reduced in individuals 
with schizophrenia but restored following the treatment with antipsychotics. 
Syt11 deficiency in dopamine neurons in early adolescence, but not in adults, 
leads to persistent social deficits and other schizophrenia-like behaviors by 
mediating dopamine over-transmission in mice. Accordingly, dopamine neuron 
over-excitation before late adolescence induces persistent 
schizophrenia-associated behavioral deficits, along with the structural and 
functional alternations in the mPFC. Notably, local intervention of D2R with 
clinical drugs presynaptically or postsynaptically exhibits both acute and 
long-lasting therapeutic effects on social deficits in schizophrenia mice 
models. These findings not only define Syt11 as a risk factor and DA 
over-transmission as a potential risk factor initiating schizophrenia, but also 
propose two D2R-targeting strategies for the comprehensive and long-term 
recovery of schizophrenia-associated social withdrawal.

BACKGROUND: Poor affect recognition is an early sign of frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD). Here, we applied the abbreviated version of the Comprehensive Affect 
Testing System (CATS-A) battery to Italian FTD cases and healthy controls (HC) 
to provide cut-offs of emotional dysfunction in the whole group and in different 
FTD clinical syndromes.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine FTD patients (60 behavioural variant [bvFTD],13 
semantic behavioural variant of FTD [sbvFTD], 28 progressive supranuclear palsy 
[PSP], 21 semantic [svPPA] and 17 nonfluent [nfvPPA] variants of primary 
progressive aphasia) and 116 HC were administered the CATS-A, yielding an 
Affective Recognition Quotient (ARQ), which was used as outcome measure. Age- 
and education-adjusted, regression-based norms were derived in HC. In patients, 
the ARQ was assessed for its internal reliability, factorial validity and 
construct validity by testing its association with another social cognition 
paradigm, the Story-Based Empath Task (SET). The diagnostic accuracy of the ARQ 
in discriminating patients from HC, genetic cases from HC and patient groups 
among each other was tested via ROC analyses.
RESULTS: In the whole FTD cohort, CATS-A proved to be underpinned by a 
mono-component factor (51.1%) and was internally consistent (McDonald's 
ω = 0.76). Moreover, the ARQ converged with the SET (r(122) = 0.50; p < 0.001) 
and optimally discriminated HC from both the whole cohort (AUC = 0.89) and each 
clinical syndrome (AUC range: 0.83-0.92). Conversely, CATS-A subtests were able 
to distinguish patient groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The ARQ score from the CATS-A distinguishes FTD clinical syndromes 
from HC with high accuracy, making it an excellent tool for immediate use in 
clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: With advances in medicine and the resultant increased ageing 
population, dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, has become a leading cause 
of death in individuals aged over 65 years in nursing homes. The unpredictable 
trajectory of the disease, marked by cognitive and functional decline, 
necessitates intensive healthcare and poses challenges to end-of-life (EoL) care 
decisions, particularly because majority of the affected individuals become 
unable to make their own decisions. This highlights the importance of advance 
care planning (ACP) programmes that enable individuals with dementia to define 
and communicate their EoL care decisions in advance. In this systematic review 
and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of ACP in nursing homes 
for patients with dementia and their caregivers.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will include 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that evaluate the 
effectiveness of ACP programmes in improving EoL outcomes in individuals with 
dementia and their caregivers in nursing homes. EoL outcomes include (1) quality 
of life; (2) caregiver satisfaction; (3) advance directives completion rate, 
which refers to the proportion of individuals with completed, documented EoL 
care preferences; (4) uptake of ACP discussion indicating the frequency or 
occurrence of these discussions between healthcare providers, patients and/or 
family members; and (5) comfort in the last week of life. Studies will be 
retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov between 
their inception and 31 January 2024. Eligible articles will be selected 
according to prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the 
included articles will be assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2.0 for 
RCTs and risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions for 
observational studies. The certainty of evidence will be evaluated using the 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. 
Publication bias will be assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's test to detect 
any asymmetry in the distribution of effect sizes across studies. Sensitivity 
and subgroup analyses will be conducted to address heterogeneity.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was not required for this systematic 
review and meta-analysis, as it involves the synthesis of existing literature 
without direct data collection or patient participation. The results of this 
study will be compiled into a detailed report, which will be submitted for 
publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, the findings will be 
shared with academic partners, healthcare professionals and organisations 
involved in dementia care, as well as policymakers and stakeholders in the field 
of long-term care for individuals with dementia.

The medial frontal cortex (mFC) and locus ceruleus (LC) are two brain areas that 
have been implicated in a range of cognitive phenomena, such as attention, 
memory, and decision-making. Regulators of these brain regions at the molecular 
level are not well understood but might help to elucidate underlying mechanisms 
of disorders that present with deficits in these cognitive domains. To probe 
this, we used chemogenetic stimulation of neurons in the LC with axonal 
projections to the prelimbic subregion (PrL) of the mFC and subsequent bulk RNA 
sequencing from the mouse PrL. We found that stimulation of this circuit caused 
an increase in transcription of a host of genes, including the Apoe gene. To 
investigate cell type-specific expression of Apoe in the PrL, we used a 
dual-virus approach to express either the excitatory DREADD receptor hM3Dq in LC 
neurons with projections to the PrL or a control virus and found that increases 
in Apoe expression in the PrL following depolarization of LC inputs is enriched 
in GABAergic neurons in a sex-dependent manner. The results of these experiments 
yield insights into how Apoe expression affects function in a cortical 
microcircuit that is important for attention, memory, and decision-making and 
point to interneuron-specific expression of Apoe as a potential biomarker for 
circuit function in disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.

Ipriflavone (IPRI), an isoflavone derivative, is clinically used to prevent 
postmenopausal bone loss in addition to its antioxidant and cognitive benefits. 
However, its poor aqueous solubility retained its bioavailability. New 
strategies have been developed to improve the bioavailability and solubility of 
neurological medications to enhance their potency and limit adverse effects. 
This study aimed to prepare targeted IPRI-poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) 
nanoparticles coupled with Tet-1 peptide to increase the therapeutic potency of 
IPRI in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Streptozotocin (STZ) 
exacerbates Alzheimer-related alterations by promoting central insulin 
resistance resulted from defective signaling pathways related to 
neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) 
injection of STZ was used to introduce the AD model. Icv-STZ injection 
significantly affected brain insulin, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and 
apoptotic indicators and caused behavioral abnormalities. STZ promoted the 
formation of amyloid β42 (Aβ42) by increasing BACE1 and reducing ADAM10 and 
ADAM17 expression levels. STZ also triggered the accumulation of neurofibrillary 
tangles and synaptic dysfunction, which are crucial for neurological 
impairments. Icv-STZ injection showed evident degenerative changes in the 
pyramidal cell layer and significantly reduced the count of viable cells in both 
CA1 and prefrontal cortex, indicating increased neuronal cell death. IPRI 
successfully ameliorated cognitive dysfunction by improving the phosphorylated 
forms of cAMP-response element-binding protein (pCREB) and extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) related to synaptic plasticity. Targeted 
IPRI nanoparticles exceeded free IPRI potential in reducing oxidative stress, 
acetylcholinesterase/monoamine oxidase activities, Tau phosphorylation, and Aβ42 
levels revealing less degenerative changes and increased viable neuron counts. 
IPRI-targeted nanoparticles improved the neuroprotective potential of free IPRI, 
making this strategy applicable to treat many neurodegenerative diseases. 
Finally, the in silico study predicted its ability to cross the BBB and to bind 
various protein targets in the brain.

Research on epigenetic‒environmental interactions in the development of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has accelerated rapidly in recent decades. Numerous 
studies have demonstrated the contribution of ambient particulate matter (PM) to 
the onset of AD. Emerging evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), 
including long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, and microRNAs, play a role in the 
pathophysiology of AD. In this review, we provide an overview of PM-altered 
ncRNAs in the brain, with emphasis on their potential roles in the pathogenesis 
of AD. These results suggest that these PM-altered ncRNAs are involved in the 
regulation of amyloid-beta pathology, microtubule-associated protein Tau 
pathology, synaptic dysfunction, damage to the blood‒brain barrier, microglial 
dysfunction, dysmyelination, and neuronal loss. In addition, we utilized in 
silico analysis to explore the biological functions of PM-altered ncRNAs in the 
development of AD. This review summarizes the knowns and unknowns of PM-altered 
ncRNAs in AD pathogenesis and discusses the current dilemma regarding PM-altered 
ncRNAs as promising biomarkers of AD. Altogether, this is the first thorough 
review of the connection between PM exposure and ncRNAs in AD pathogenesis, 
which may offer novel insights into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of 
AD associated with ambient PM exposure.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a growing global 
health challenge. ADRD place significant physical, emotional, and financial 
burdens on informal caregivers and negatively affects their well-being. 
Web-based social media platforms have emerged as valuable sources of peer 
support for these caregivers. However, there has been limited investigation into 
how web-based peer support might influence their mental well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the dynamics of sentiment scores, a major 
indicator of mental well-being, among informal ADRD caregivers, specifically how 
their sentiment changes as they participate in caregiving experience discussions 
within 2 ADRD web-based communities.
METHODS: We collected data from 2 large web-based ADRD caregiving communities, 
ALZConnected (from November 2011 to August 2022) and TalkingPoint (from March 
2003 to November 2022). Using the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment 
Reasoning and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, we calculated sentiment scores 
for each post and evaluated how the initial sentiment score of a topic initiator 
evolves within a discussion thread. Structured topic modeling and regression 
analysis were used to identify the primary topics consistently associated with 
sentiment changes within these threads. We investigated longitudinal sentiment 
trends to identify patterns of sentimental stability or enhancement due to 
prolonged engagement in web-based communities by plotting linear interpolation 
lines of the sentiment values of each individual user.
RESULTS: The ALZConnected dataset comprised 532,992 posts, consisting of 57,641 
topic threads and 475,351 comments. The TalkingPoint dataset was composed of 
846,344 posts, consisting of 81,068 topic threads and 765,276 comments. Our 
research revealed that topic initiators experienced a notable increase in 
sentiment as they engaged in subsequent discussions within their threads, with a 
significant uptick in positivity in the short term. This phenomenon is part of a 
broader trend of steadily rising positive sentiment among ADRD caregivers. Using 
structured topic modeling, we cataloged a diverse range of topics that included 
both emotional aspects, such as family emotions, and practical concerns, such as 
diagnosis and treatment and everyday care practices. We observed that sentiment 
scores were positively aligned with discussions about family and daily routines 
life (coefficient=3.53; P<.001), while topics related to illness 
(coefficient=-1.37; P<.001) and caregiving facilities (coefficient=-1.98; 
P<.001) tended to correlate with lower sentiment scores. This evidence 
highlights the significant impact that both the time of participation and the 
posting content have on the sentiment changes of caregivers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies sentiment changes among informal ADRD 
caregivers through their interactions in 2 extensive web-based communities. 
These findings emphasize the importance of early emotional support within a 
topic thread and demonstrate a predominantly positive sentiment in these 
communities over time. These further highlight the value of web-based peer 
support and its potential to enhance the emotional well-being of informal ADRD 
caregivers.

carotenoid in the stigma of saffron, possesses radical scavenging, 
anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. This study investigates the 
protective impact of crocin on neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, and memory deficits induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in 
rats. Male Wistar rats received 100 mg/kg of crocin for 12 days, with LPS 
(1 mg/kg, ip) injected on days 8-12. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated 
in the Morris water maze two hours after LPS injection. Gene expression of 
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), caspase 3, and 
lipid peroxidation was assessed in hippocampal homogenates at the end of the 
behavioral test. Histopathological changes in the hippocampus and cerebral 
cortex were evaluated using H&E staining. The results indicated that LPS 
administration caused spatial learning and memory dysfunction (P = 0.001, 
P < 0.01) accompanied by upregulation of Nfkb, Tnfα, and Casp3 mRNA expression 
(P < 0.0001), increased TNF-α (P < 0.01) and lipid peroxidation level 
(P < 0.01), decreased total thiol concentration (P < 0.05), tissue damage and 
neuronal loss in the hippocampus (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, crocin treatment at 
a dosage of 100 mg/kg attenuated learning and memory impairments (P = 0.001, 
P < 0.01), downregulated Nfkb, Tnfα, and Casp3 mRNA expression (P < 0.0001), 
decreased TNF-α level (P < 0.01) and lipid peroxidation (P < 0.05) and increased 
total thiol level (P < 0.05) in the hippocampus. Crocin also ameliorated 
LPS-induced pathological changes and neuronal loss in the hippocampus 
(P < 0.001) and cerebral cortex (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the neuroprotective 
effects of crocin against LPS-induced histopathological and behavioral changes 
could be attributed to its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and 
radical-scavenging activities in the rat brain.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with 
limited treatment options. Neurofeedback, a technique that trains brainwaves, 
has shown promise in addressing cognitive impairments.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a bibliometric analysis to explore the current research 
on neurofeedback as a treatment for AD.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed based on PRISMA guidelines 
on 142 papers. Different bibliometric parameters like the author's country, 
author names, keywords, journal names, and country of citations were analyzed, 
and a network visualization chart was generated to understand the correlation of 
Alzheimer-related search terms to neurofeedback.
RESULTS: Research is concentrated in Europe and North America, with a 
significant gap in Asian countries. A growing body of evidence supports the 
potential benefits of neurofeedback for AD. A strong correlation has been found 
between neurofeedback and AD-related terms. Clinical trials suggest positive 
outcomes for neurofeedback in improving cognitive impairments and working 
memory.
CONCLUSION: Neurofeedback shows promise as a potential treatment for AD. Further 
research and clinical studies are needed to explore the full potential of 
neurofeedback for enhancing the quality of life for individuals with AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline, posing a significant challenge for 
individuals and society. Early detection and treatment are essential for 
effective disease management.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to develop a novel and 
interpretable deep learning model for rapid and accurate Alzheimer's disease 
detection, incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. 
The model aims to ensure generalizability through cross-validation and data 
augmentation, while enhancing interpretability and transparency by using 
Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods such as Grad-CAM, SHAP, and LIME, 
alongside an Enhanced Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm to clarify feature 
categorization and improve understanding of the model's decision-making process.
METHODS: The proposed model employs a multi-stage approach. Initially, MRI scans 
are transformed into feature vectors suitable for input into a Deep 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Subsequently, an Enhanced Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) 
algorithm, incorporating spatial information, refines these features to improve 
clustering precision. The model integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence 
techniques, including Grad-CAM, SHAP, and LIME, to elucidate critical features 
and regions influencing classification outcomes. The performance metrics such as 
Accuracy, Recall and Specificity are used for assessing the performance of the 
model.
RESULTS: The XAI-DEF Alzheimer's disease detection model consistently 
demonstrated exceptional performance across both the ADNI and OASIS datasets. On 
ADNI, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.39%, recall of 99.47%, and 
specificity of 99.3%. Similarly, on OASIS, the model attained an accuracy of 
99.36%, recall of 99.53%, and specificity of 99.15%. These results underscore 
the model's effectiveness in accurately classifying Alzheimer's disease cases 
while minimizing false positives and negatives.
CONCLUSION: Through the development of this model, we contribute to the 
advancement of dependable diagnostic tools tailored for the detection and 
management of Alzheimer's disease. By prioritizing interpretability alongside 
accuracy, our approach provides valuable insights into the decisionmaking 
process of the model, ultimately improving patient outcomes and facilitating 
further research in neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence and severity are associated 
with increased age, female sex, and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype. Although 
estrogen therapy (ET) effectively reduces symptoms of menopause including hot 
flashes and anxiety, and can reduce dementia risk, it is associated with 
increased risks of breast and uterine cancer due to estrogen receptor alpha 
(ERα)-mediated increases in cancer cell proliferation. Because ERβ activation 
reduces this cell proliferation, selective targeting of ERβ may provide a safer 
method of improving memory and reducing hot flashes in menopausal women, 
including those with AD. APOE genotype influences the response to ET, although 
it is unknown whether effects of ERβ activation vary by genotype.
METHODS: Here, we tested the ability of long-term oral treatment with a novel 
highly selective ERβ agonist, EGX358, to enhance object recognition and spatial 
recognition memory, reduce drug-induced hot flashes, and influence anxiety-like 
behaviors in female mice expressing 5 familial AD mutations (5xFAD-Tg) and human 
APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE3 and APOE4 (E3/4FAD). Mice were ovariectomized at 5 months 
of age and were then treated orally with vehicle (DMSO) or EGX358 (10 mg/kg/day) 
via hydrogel for 8 weeks. Spatial and object recognition memory were tested in 
object placement (OP) and object recognition (OR) tasks, respectively, and 
anxiety-like behaviors were tested in the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze 
(EPM). Hot flash-like symptoms (change in tail skin temperature) were measured 
following injection of the neurokinin receptor agonist senktide (0.5 mg/kg).
RESULTS: EGX358 enhanced object recognition memory in E3FAD and E3/4FAD mice but 
did not affect spatial recognition memory. EGX358 also reduced senktide-induced 
tail temperature elevations in E3FAD, but not E3/4FAD, females. EGX358 did not 
influence anxiety-like behaviors or body weight.
DISCUSSION: These data indicate that highly selective ERβ agonism can facilitate 
object recognition memory in both APOE3 homozygotes and APOE3/4 heterozygotes, 
but only reduce the magnitude of a drug-induced hot flash in APOE3 homozygotes, 
suggesting that APOE4 genotype may blunt the beneficial effects of ET on hot 
flashes. Collectively, these data suggest a potentially beneficial effect of 
selective ERβ agonism for memory and hot flashes in females with AD-like 
pathology, but that APOE genotype plays an important role in responsiveness.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and tau phosphorylation-induced 
neurofibrillary tangles. This review comprehensively summarizes AD pathogenesis 
and related factors, drawing on a wealth of authoritative reports and research 
findings. Specifically, we delve into the intricate mechanisms underlying AD 
pathology, including Aβ deposition, tau protein phosphorylation, cholinergic 
dysfunction, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial oxidative stress, ferroptosis, 
imbalance in the gut microbiota, and microRNA dysregulation. We also explored 
the effects of these factors on the brain, including synaptic damage and 
cognitive impairment. Moreover, our review highlights the associations between 
the pathogenesis of AD and inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood and 
cerebrospinal fluid, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and changes in microRNA 
expression. Overall, we provided a systematic and illustrative overview of the 
pathogenesis and therapeutic drugs for AD, offering help in the prevention and 
treatment of this condition.

INTRODUCTION: The vast majority of studies on aging, cognition, and dementia 
focus on non-Hispanic white subjects. This paper adds to the extant literature 
by providing insight into the African American aging experience. Here we 
describe the study design and baseline characteristics of the African American 
Dementia and Aging Project (AADAPt) study, which is exploring aging and 
cognition in African American older adults in Oregon.
METHODS: African American older adults (n = 177) participated in AADAPt, a 
longitudinal study that collected data on cognitive, physical, and social 
functioning in annual visits since 2000.
RESULTS: AADAPt participants had risk factors for developing dementia in future, 
such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but also reported protective factors 
such as high social engagement.
DISCUSSION: The AADAPt project offers new insights into aging in older African 
Americans that includes data on cognition, social engagement, and physical 
health, which are crucial for understanding the experience of under-represented 
groups and making future studies more inclusive.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are prevalent in the elderly. The pathogenesis 
of NDDs is complex, and currently, there is no cure available. With the increase 
in aging population, over 20 million people are affected by common NDDs alone 
(Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). Therefore, NDDs have profound 
negative impacts on patients, their families, and society, making them a major 
global health concern. Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs) belong to the 
serine/threonine protein kinases family, which modulate diverse cellular 
processes (e.g., apoptosis). ROCKs may elevate the risk of various NDDs 
(including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease) 
by disrupting synaptic plasticity and promoting inflammatory responses. 
Therefore, ROCK inhibitors have been regarded as ideal therapies for NDDs in 
recent years. Fasudil, one of the classic ROCK inhibitor, is a potential drug 
for treating NDDs, as it repairs nerve damage and promotes axonal regeneration. 
Thus, the current review summarizes the relationship between ROCKs and NDDs and 
the mechanism by which fasudil inhibits ROCKs to provide new ideas for the 
treatment of NDDs.

Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) refers to a class of circular, non-chromosomal DNA 
that has recently gained widespread attention due to its potential role in aging 
and neurodegenerative diseases. The generation of ecDNA is closely associated 
with processes such as double-strand breaks, micronuclei formation, and the 
breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle, all of which are integral to regulation of 
gene expression, genetic stability, and clonal evolution. In neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's 
disease, the aberrant formation of ecDNA is closely linked to defects in DNA 
repair, alterations in synaptic plasticity, and neuronal dysfunction. The 
distinct distribution and functional roles of ecDNA in these conditions make it 
a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. This review provides an 
overview of the mechanisms underlying ecDNA formation and its functions in the 
nervous system. Additionally, it explores the clinical potential of ecDNA in 
disease diagnosis, targeted therapy, and personalized medicine, offering new 
insights for future research and treatment strategies.
