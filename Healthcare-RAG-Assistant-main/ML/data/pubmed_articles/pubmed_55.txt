Tauopathy is one of the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias (ADRD). At present, there have been many studies on the formation, 
deposition, and intercellular transmission of tau in neurons and immune cells. 
The vasculature is an important component of the central nervous system. This 
review discusses the interaction between vasculature and tau in detail from 
three aspects. (1) The vascular risk factors (VRFs) discussed in this review 
include diabetes mellitus (DM), abnormal blood pressure (BP), and 
hypercholesterolemia. (2) In ADRD pathology, the hyperphosphorylation and 
deposition of tau interact with disrupted vasculature, such as different cells 
(endothelial cells, smooth muscular cells, and pericytes), the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), and the cerebral lymphatic system. (3) The functions of 
vasculature are regulated by various signaling transductions. Endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase/nitric oxide, calcium signaling, Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil 
containing Kinase, and receptors for advanced glycation end products are 
discussed in this review. Our findings indicate that the prevention and 
treatment of vascular health may be a potential target for ADRD combination 
therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: Persistent VRFs increase early disruption of vascular 
mechanisms and are strongly associated with tau pathology in ADRD. Cell 
dysfunction in the vasculature causes BBB leakage and drainage incapacity of the 
cerebral lymphatic system, which interacts with tau pathology. Signaling 
molecules in the vasculature regulate vasodilation and contraction, 
angiogenesis, and CBF. Abnormal signaling transduction is related to tau 
hyperphosphorylation and deposition.

INTRODUCTION: To investigate the associations of metabotropic glutamate receptor 
5 (mGluR5) with tau deposition and cognitive ability in patients with early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Twenty-six cognitively impaired (CI) and 14 cognitively unimpaired (CU) 
individuals underwent mGluR5 positron emission tomography (PET) ([18F]PSS232), 
amyloid PET ([18F]florbetapir), and tau PET ([18F]MK6240), and 
neuropsychological assessment. The relationships among mGluR5 availability, tau 
deposition, and neuropsychological assessment were analyzed using Spearman's 
correlation and mediation analyses.
RESULTS: CI patients had lower mGluR5 in the hippocampus than CU (standardized 
uptake value ratio [SUVr]: 2.03 ± 0.25 vs 1.79 ± 0.17, p = 0.003). Hippocampal 
mGluR5 was negatively associated with hippocampal tau deposition (r = -.46, 
p = 0.003) and positively associated with cognitive performance, but only in 
women. Hippocampal tau deposition mediated the effect of mGluR5 on cognitive 
performance.
DISCUSSION: Reduced hippocampal mGluR5 is negatively related with tau deposition 
in most cortical regions and positively associated with cognitive performance, 
making it a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis and therapy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitively impaired (CI) patients exhibited lower metabotropic 
glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) availability in the hippocampus than cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) subjects. Hippocampal mGluR5 availability was negatively 
associated with tau deposition in widespread cortex. Hippocampal mGluR5 
availability was positively associated with cognitive performance. The close 
association of mGluR5 with tau and cognition performance exists only in females. 
Tau pathology mediated the relationship between mGluR5 availability and 
cognition.

INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies indicate a link between 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and elevated risk of dementia. 
However, the impact of ADHD on cognition and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers 
in individuals with cognitive impairment remains unclear.
METHODS: We computed weighted ADHD polygenic risk scores (ADHD-PRS) in 938 
cognitively impaired participants (674 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 264 
dementia; mean age 73.5 years). A subset underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
analysis for amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau, as well as 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET).
RESULTS: We observed lower executive function in individuals with high ADHD-PRS 
for both MCI and dementia participants. Higher levels of CSF phosphorylated tau, 
but not Aβ, were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. 
Increased ADHD-PRS was associated with glucose hypometabolism in the frontal and 
parietal cortices.
DISCUSSION: ADHD-PRS is associated with a more severe disease presentation in 
individuals with cognitive impairment due to dementia, characterized by impaired 
executive function, elevated tau pathology, and hypometabolism in the frontal 
and parietal cortices.
HIGHLIGHTS: We calculated the genetic liability for 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using polygenic risk scores 
(ADHD-PRS). Elevated ADHD-PRS was associated with executive function deficits in 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
dementia. Higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau, but not 
amyloid beta (Aβ), were observed in dementia participants with higher ADHD-PRS. 
Higher ADHD-PRS was associated with brain hypometabolism in individuals with AD 
dementia. Hypometabolism in the parietal cortex mediated the effects of ADHD-PRS 
on executive function.

COVID-19 was a nightmare in humankind's history that challenged our advanced 
medical technology. All credit goes to the researchers who played a crucial role 
in curbing COVID-19 and proved our medical technology supremacy. However, 
COVID-19 has left some mysterious scars on human well-being. It is believed that 
COVID-19 has a significant negative impact on various cardiovascular (CVS) and 
central nervous system (CNS) diseases, especially in the case of CNS diseases 
like Alzheimer's. Surprisingly, COVID-19 affects the respiratory system, whereas 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters brain function. To explain this phenomenon, 
several hypotheses were proposed, but the mechanism needs to be clearly 
understood. Another critical thing to be concerned about is that COVID-19 will 
worsen pre-existing conditions and lead to the onset of AD. In the race to curb 
COVID-19, the invention of vaccines was speeded up, and it is necessary to fight 
against COVID-19. However, postvaccination follow-up is mandatory when an 
individual is a victim of AD. In this review article, we compiled the various 
dreadful effects of the COVID-19 virus on AD, the Post effects of the virus on 
AD, and the effect of the COVID-19 vaccination on AD. This article provides a 
new direction for research concerning COVID-19 and AD.

INTRODUCTION: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been 
widely studied, but direct comparisons of several biomarkers in clinical 
settings remain limited.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, plasma biomarkers from 197 participants 
in the BIODEGMAR cohort (Hospital del Mar, Barcelona) were analyzed. 
Participants were classified based on AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core 
biomarkers. We assessed the ability of plasma p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, 
t-tau, and Aβ42/40 to classify Aβ pathology status.
RESULTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers had a greater diagnostic performance and larger 
effect sizes compared to t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Aβ pathology. 
Among them, plasma p-tau217 consistently outperformed the others, demonstrating 
superior area under the curves. Furthermore, p-tau217 showed the strongest 
correlation between plasma and CSF levels, underscoring its potential as a 
reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers.
DISCUSSION: Several plasma biomarkers, targeting different epitopes and using 
different platforms, demonstrated high performance in detecting AD in a memory 
clinic setting.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma p-tau biomarkers demonstrated higher diagnostic performance 
and larger effect sizes than t-tau and Aβ42/40 assays in detecting Alzheimer's 
disease. Among the p-tau biomarkers, p-tau217 assays consistently outperformed 
the others, providing superior classification of Aβ pathology status across 
different phosphorylation sites. p-tau217 assays showed the strongest 
correlation between plasma and CSF levels, indicating its potential as a 
reliable surrogate for CSF biomarkers. Several plasma p-tau biomarkers can be 
used in a specialized memory clinic to accurately detect Alzheimer's disease.

Clinical studies have revealed a significant correlation between pain and 
neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, due 
to cognitive and speech impairments, AD patients, especially those in moderate 
to severe stages, are often overlooked in pain management. The challenges in 
obtaining pain-related information from this population exacerbate the issue. 
Although recent clinical research has increasingly recognized the comorbidity of 
AD and pain, the pathological alterations and interactive mechanisms underlying 
this relationship remain inadequately explored. This review provides a 
comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and pathological mechanisms of 
AD with and without pain comorbidity. It examines underlying processes, 
including neuroinflammation, peripheral-central immune interactions, and 
neurotransmitter dynamics. Furthermore, it highlights current pain assessment 
and management strategies in AD patients. By offering a theoretical framework, 
this review aims to support the development of effective pain management 
approaches and serve as a reference for clinical interventions targeting 
AD-associated pain. HIGHLIGHTS: The comorbidity between AD and CP encompasses 
multiple interrelated biological pathways, such as neurodegeneration and 
inflammatory responses. The damage to neurons and synapses in AD patients 
influences the brain regions responsible for processing pain, thereby reducing 
the pain response. Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the development of 
both AD and CP. Enhanced inflammatory responses have an impact on the CNS and 
promote sensitization. Common neurotransmitter alterations exist in the 
comorbidity of AD and CP, influencing cognition, emotion, and pain perception.

Targeting Amyloid Pathology in Early Alzheimer's: The Promise of Donanemab-Azbt.

Khartabil N(1), Awaness A(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Pharmacy, West Coast University, Anaheim, CA 92801, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to examine the potential role of 
donanemab-azbt in the treatment and management of early-stage Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), with a focus on its efficacy, safety, and clinical relevance based 
on data from key clinical trials.
DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was conducted using 
relevant keywords such as "donanemab", "Alzheimer's disease", "Kisunla", 
"TRAILBLAZER clinical trials", and "amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
(ARIA)". Additional data were extracted from clinical trial records 
(clinicaltrials.gov), conference abstracts, and product monographs.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Only English-language studies conducted in 
human populations were included. Clinical trials and peer-reviewed studies 
detailing the efficacy, safety, and mechanistic insights of donanemab-azbt were 
prioritized.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Key findings from the TRAILBLAZER series of clinical trials 
highlighted the potential of donanemab-azbt in slowing cognitive and functional 
decline in early-stage AD: (1) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ (Phase 2): This trial focused on 
participants with intermediate levels of tau protein. Results demonstrated a 
statistically significant slowing of cognitive and functional decline. (2) 
TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (Phase 3): A large-scale, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study confirmed the efficacy of donanemab-azbt in reducing 
amyloid plaque accumulation and cognitive decline. Key results included a 35% 
slowing of decline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) 
and a 36% slowing on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). 
Additional secondary outcomes showed improvements in activities of daily living 
and reduced risk of disease progression. (3) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3: This ongoing 
trial is evaluating donanemab's potential in delaying or preventing Alois 
Alzheimer in cognitively normal individuals with amyloid plaques, broadening the 
scope of early intervention strategies. (4) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4: A head-to-head 
comparison with aducanumab revealed superior amyloid plaque clearance with 
donanemab. (5) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 5: Currently recruiting, this trial aims to 
evaluate safety and efficacy across diverse populations with varying tau levels 
and comorbidities. (6) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 (Phase 3b): This trial investigates 
modified dosing regimens to reduce ARIA while maintaining efficacy, particularly 
in populations with genetic risk factors like ApoE ε4 homozygotes.
RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Donanemab-azbt represents a 
promising treatment option for patients with early-stage AD. It specifically 
targets and reduces amyloid beta plaques, a hallmark of the disease, potentially 
slowing progression and preserving cognitive function. However, its 
administration requires careful patient selection, including genetic testing for 
ApoE ε4 status, to mitigate risks of ARIA. Furthermore, the findings emphasize 
the importance of close monitoring during treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Donanemab-azbt offers a new avenue for managing early-stage AD, 
showing promise in reducing amyloid burden and slowing cognitive decline. While 
its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical trials, further 
research is essential to validate long-term outcomes, assess effectiveness 
across diverse populations, and refine dosing strategies to minimize side 
effects. With continued investigation, donanemab-azbt could significantly impact 
the clinical landscape of AD treatment.

Neurodegenerative diseases comprise a group of chronic, usually age-related, 
disorders characterized by progressive neuronal loss, deformation of neuronal 
structure, or loss of neuronal function, leading to a substantially reduced 
quality of life. They remain a significant focus of scientific and clinical 
interest due to their increasing medical and social importance. Most 
neurodegenerative diseases present intracellular protein aggregation or their 
extracellular deposition (plaques), such as α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease 
and amyloid beta (Aβ)/tau aggregates in Alzheimer's. Conventional treatments for 
neurodegenerative conditions incur high costs and are related to the development 
of several adverse effects. In addition, many patients are irresponsive to them. 
For these reasons, there is a growing tendency to find new therapeutic 
approaches to help patients. This review intends to investigate some 
phytocompounds' effects on neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions are 
generally related to increased oxidative stress and inflammation, so 
phytocompounds can help prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve 
our aim to provide a critical assessment of the current literature about 
phytochemicals targeting neurodegeneration, we reviewed reputable databases, 
including PubMed, EMBASE, and COCHRANE, seeking clinical trials that utilized 
phytochemicals against neurodegenerative conditions. A few clinical trials 
investigated the effects of phytocompounds in humans, and after screening, 13 
clinical trials were ultimately included following PRISMA guidelines. These 
compounds include polyphenols (flavonoids such as luteolin and quercetin, 
phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, and 
other polyphenols like resveratrol), alkaloids (such as berberine, huperzine A, 
and caffeine), and terpenoids (such as ginkgolides and limonene). The gathered 
evidence underscores that quercetin, caffeine, ginkgolides, and other 
phytochemicals are primarily anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
neuroprotective, counteracting neuroinflammation, neuronal oxidation, and 
synaptic dysfunctions, which are crucial aspects of neurodegenerative disease 
intervention in various included conditions, such as Alzheimer's and other 
dementias, depression, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, they show 
that the use of these compounds is related to significant improvements in 
cognition, memory, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant behavior, 
hallucinations, and mood disorders.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a central nervous system degenerative disease 
closely related to age with a complex pathogenesis. As a natural medicinal 
plant, forest-grown ginseng (GSF) contains abundant ginsenosides and offers 
significant neuroprotective effects.
METHODS: In this study, we comprehensively investigated the effect of GSF on the 
cell viability of PC12 cells in an AD model alongside metabolic changes in the 
serum and brains of mice, combined with an efficacy evaluation of PC12 cells in 
vitro and UHPLC-MS-based metabolomics in vivo. The goal of this study is to 
clarify the potential mechanism of GSF in treating AD.
RESULTS: The PC12 cell results showed that GSF can promote the proliferation of 
PC12 cells, reduce the content of IL-8, increase the activity of SOD, and 
alleviate the inflammation and oxidative stress induced by Aβ25~35. The 
immunohistochemical results for the mouse brain tissue also showed that GSF 
could reduce the inflammatory response of mouse brain tissue by reducing the 
overexpression of IBa1. AD was alleviated by reducing Aβ protein deposition in 
the mouse brain tissue. An untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed using 
UHPLC-Q-Exactive MS and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the 
differentially expressed metabolites in the serum and brain tissue of AD mice 
after treatment. Twenty and seventeen different metabolites were identified in 
the serum and brain tissue, respectively. The pathway enrichment analysis of 
differential metabolites showed that GSF could treat AD by up-regulating 
succinic acid semialdehyde, carbamoyl phosphate, Sphingosine 1-phosphate, 
L-cystathionine, 2-ketobutyric acid, Vanillylmandelic acid, and D-Ribose to 
regulate sphingomyelin metabolism, the synthesis and metabolism of 
neurotransmitters and precursors, and energy metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: GSF can reduce neuroinflammation and alleviate Alzheimer's disease 
by regulating the metabolic disorders of amino acids, sphingolipids, unsaturated 
fatty acids, and arachidonic acid in mice serum and brain tissue metabolites. 
These results suggest a link between metabolite imbalance and AD, and reveal the 
basis for the mechanism of ginsenosides in AD treatment.

Therapeutic Role of Heterocyclic Compounds in Neurodegenerative Diseases: 
Insights from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.

of Korea.

Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are the most common neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDDs). The development of aberrant protein aggregates and the progressive and 
permanent loss of neurons are the major characteristic features of these 
disorders. Although the precise mechanisms causing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown, there is a wealth of evidence 
suggesting that misfolded proteins, accumulation of misfolded proteins, 
dysfunction of neuroreceptors and mitochondria, dysregulation of enzymes, and 
the release of neurotransmitters significantly influence the pathophysiology of 
these diseases. There is no effective protective medicine or therapy available 
even with the availability of numerous medications. There is an urgent need to 
create new and powerful bioactive compounds since the number of people with NDDs 
is rising globally. Heterocyclic compounds have consistently played a pivotal 
role in drug discovery due to their exceptional pharmaceutical properties. Many 
clinically approved drugs, such as galantamine hydrobromide, donepezil 
hydrochloride, memantine hydrochloride, and opicapone, feature heterocyclic 
cores. As these heterocyclic compounds have exceptional therapeutic potential, 
heterocycles are an intriguing research topic for the development of new 
effective therapeutic drugs for PD and AD. This review aims to provide current 
insights into the development and potential use of heterocyclic compounds 
targeting diverse therapeutic targets to manage and potentially treat patients 
with AD and PD.

Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome 
and is important for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
With the expansion of biomarker-based diagnostics, the aim of this study is to 
clarify the current attitudes towards and the use of MCI, and MCI due to AD, in 
German memory clinics. Methods: An online survey (50 items) was performed in 
2022 among specialized clinicians (N = 45) in German memory clinics to assess 
the use of MCI and biomarkers in current diagnosis and treatment. Attitudinal 
and frequency items were assessed with a five-point numeric scale (strongly 
disagree = 1 to completely agree = 5 and never = 1 to always = 5, respectively). 
Results: All respondents used MCI as a clinical diagnosis. The benefits of 
diagnosing MCI were labeling deficits as disease symptoms (M = 4.4, SD = 0.7), 
improving coping with symptoms (M = 4.1, SD = 0.9), and motivating risk 
reduction activities (M = 4.0, SD = 0.9). Overall, 37 respondents used 
specialized diagnostic criteria for MCI due to AD, and all had access to 
biomarker diagnostics. Patients with MCI due to AD received more frequent 
counseling on memory training (p < 0.001), other non-pharmacological treatments 
(p < 0.001), and antidementive drug treatment (p < 0.001) than patients with MCI 
of other etiologies. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed 
significantly more frequently to patients with MCI due to AD (p < 0.001) 
compared to other MCI patients. Conclusions: MCI is commonly used as a clinical 
diagnosis in German memory clinics. AD biomarker assessment is well established 
and influences patient counseling and treatment recommendations.

Bioactive peptides represent a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) by maintaining cholinergic system homeostasis through the 
inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This study focused on 
extracting AChE inhibitory peptides from yellowfin tuna pancreas using moderate 
ultrasound-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis (MUE). Firstly, papain and MUE stood 
out from five enzymes and four enzymatic hydrolysis methods, respectively, by 
comparing the degree of hydrolysis and AChE inhibitory activity of different 
pancreatic protein hydrolysates. Subsequently, the optimal MUE conditions were 
obtained by single-factor, Plackett-Burman, and response surface methodologies. 
The pancreatic protein hydrolysate prepared under optimal MUE conditions was 
then purified by ultrafiltration followed by RP-HPLC, from which a novel AChE 
inhibitory peptide (LLDF) was identified by LC-MS/MS and virtual screening. LLDF 
effectively inhibited AChE activity by a competitive inhibition mechanism, with 
an IC50 of 18.44 ± 0.24 μM. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation 
revealed that LLDF bound robustly to the active site of AChE via hydrogen bonds. 
These findings provided a theoretical basis for the valuable use of yellowfin 
tuna pancreas and introduced a new viewpoint on the potential therapeutic 
advantages of AChE inhibitory peptides for future AD treatment.

The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) underscores the urgent need 
for novel therapeutic agents derived from natural sources. Among flavonoids, 
3',4',5,7-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF), a structural analog of luteolin, has gained 
attention for its favorable pharmacokinetics and potential neuroprotective 
properties. Despite the significant neuroprotective effects and favorable 
pharmacokinetics of TMF, its efficacy and mechanism of action in AD remain 
unclear. This study explored TMF's pharmacological effects in AD models, 
highlighting its ability to improve memory and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 
mice. TMF reduced Aβ plaques, NFTs formation, and glial activation while 
suppressing neuroinflammation through the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. Further analysis 
in LPS-induced BV2 cells revealed TMF's ability to reduce microglial activation. 
These findings highlight the anti-neuroinflammatory activity of TMF, suggesting 
its potential as a treatment for AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and a 
significant cause of dementia in elderly individuals, with a growing prevalence 
in our aging population. Extracellular amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), intracellular 
tau proteins, and their phosphorylated forms have gained prominence as critical 
biomarkers for early and precise diagnosis of AD, correlating with disease 
progression and response to therapy. The high costs and invasiveness of 
conventional diagnostic methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), limit their suitability for large-scale or 
routine screening. However, electrochemical (EC) analysis methods have made 
significant progress in disease detection due to their high sensitivity, 
excellent specificity, portability, and cost-effectiveness. This article reviews 
the progress in EC biosensing technologies, focusing on the detection of tau 
protein biomarkers in the blood (a low-invasive, accessible diagnostic medium). 
The article then discusses various EC sensing platforms, including their 
fabrication processes, limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, and clinical 
potential to show the role of these sensors as transformers changing the face of 
AD diagnostics.

OBJECTIVE: To unveil the efficacy and ferroptosis-related mechanisms of 
Atractylodes Macrocephala Koidz (AMK) against Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is 
the most widespread neurodegenerative disease.
METHODS: Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores were used to investigate the 
relationship between ferroptosis and AD. Logistic regression with seven feature 
selections and a deep learning model were utilized to identify potential targets 
of AMK based on transcriptomic data from multiple tissues. A transcriptome-wide 
association study (TWAS), summary-data-based mendelian randomization (SMR), and 
mendelian randomization (MR) were utilized to validate the causal relationship 
between target genes and AD risk. A single-gene gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) was employed to investigate the biological pathways associated with the 
target genes. Three molecular docking strategies and a molecular dynamics 
simulation were employed to verify the binding domains interacting with AMK. 
Furthermore, the anti-AD effects of AMK were validated in a zebrafish AD model 
by testing behavior responses, apoptosis, and the deposition of beta-amyloid 
(Aβ) in the brain. Ultimately, real-time qPCR was used to verify the 
ferroptosis-related targets, which was identified via multi-omics.
RESULTS: Ferroptosis is an important pathogenic mechanism of AD, as suggested by 
the GSVA scores. AMK may exert its anti-AD activity through targets genes 
identified in the brain (ATP5MC3, GOT1, SAT1, EGFR, and MAPK9) and blood (G6PD, 
PGD, ALOX5, HMOX1, and ULK1). EGFR and HMOX1 were further confirmed as target 
genes mediating the anti-AD activity of AMK through TWAS, SMR, and MR analyses. 
The GSEA results indicated that EGFR may be involved in oxidative 
phosphorylation-related pathways, while HMOX1 may be associated with lysosome 
and phagosome pathways. The results of three molecular docking strategies and 
molecular dynamics simulations implied that the kinase domain of EGFR and the 
catalytic domain of HMOX1 played pivotal roles in the interaction between AMK 
and the targets. In a zebrafish model, AD-like symptoms including motor slowness 
and delayed responses, neuronal apoptosis, and plaque deposition in the brain, 
were significantly improved after AMK treatment. Accordingly, AMK reversed the 
abnormal expression of egfra and hmox1a, two core targets genes involved in 
ferroptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: AMK significantly alleviated AD-like symptoms through the 
modulation of EGFR and HMOX1, which might reduce lipid peroxidation, thereby 
suppressing ferroptosis. This study provided evidence supporting the efficacy 
and therapeutic targets associated with ferroptosis in AMK-treated AD, which aid 
in the development of therapeutic interventions.

Cholesterol is an essential element for the development and normal function of 
the central nervous system. While peripheral cholesterol is influenced by liver 
metabolism and diet, brain cholesterol metabolism takes place in an isolated 
system due to the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, 
cross-talk occurs between the brain and periphery, specifically through 
metabolites such as oxysterols that play key roles in regulating cholesterol 
balance. Several neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or 
Parkinson's disease are considered to be affected by the loss of this balance. 
Also, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia needs to consider these discrete 
interferences between brain and peripheral cholesterol and the possible 
implications of each therapeutic approach. This is particularly important 
because of 27-hydroxycholesterol and 24-hydroxycholesterol, which can cross the 
BBB and are involved in cholesterol metabolism. This paper examines the 
metabolic pathways of cholesterol metabolism in the brain and periphery and 
focuses on the complex cross-talk between these metabolisms. Also, we emphasize 
the regulatory role of the BBB and the need for an integrated approach to 
cholesterol management.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the 
leading cause of dementia, affecting a significant proportion of the elderly 
population. AD is characterized by cognitive decline and functional impairments 
due to pathological hallmarks like amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Microglial 
activation, chronic neuroinflammation, and disruptions in neuronal communication 
further exacerbate the disease. Emerging research suggests that immune 
modulation could play a key role in AD treatment given the significant 
involvement of neuroinflammatory processes. This review focuses on recent 
advancements in immunotherapy strategies aimed at modulating immune responses in 
AD, with a specific emphasis on microglial behavior, amyloid clearance, and tau 
pathology. By exploring these immunotherapeutic approaches, we aim to provide 
insights into their potential to alter disease progression and improve patient 
outcomes, contributing to the evolving landscape of AD treatment.

Cerebral plaques of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) are a defining pathology in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The amyloid hypothesis of AD pathogenesis has 
dominated the field for over 30 years, ostensibly validated by rare AD-causing 
mutations in the substrate and enzyme that produce Aβ. The γ-secretase complex 
carries out intramembrane proteolysis of the substrate derived from the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP). Mutations in APP and presenilin, the catalytic 
component of γ-secretase, typically increase the ratio of aggregation-prone 
42-residue Aβ (Aβ42) over the more soluble 40-residue form (Aβ40). Nevertheless, 
the inability to clarify how Aβ aggregation leads to neurodegeneration, along 
with poor progress in developing effective AD therapeutics that target Aβ, 
raises concern about whether Aβ is the primary disease driver. γ-Secretase 
carries out processive proteolysis on the APP substrate, producing long Aβ 
peptides that are generally trimmed in tripeptide intervals to shorter secreted 
peptides. Recent studies on effects of AD-causing mutations on the complicated 
proteolytic processing of the APP substrate by γ-secretase has led to the 
discovery that these mutations reduce─but do not abolish─processive proteolysis. 
Reduced proteolysis is apparently due to stabilization of enzyme-substrate 
complexes, and these stalled substrate-bound γ-secretase complexes can trigger 
synaptic degeneration even in the absence of Aβ production. Thus, the stalled 
process rather than the proteolytic products may be a principal initiator of AD 
pathogenesis. This new amyloid-independent hypothesis suggests that 
pharmacological agents that rescue stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate 
complexes might be effective therapeutics for AD prevention and/or treatment.

Although large-scale genetic association studies have proven useful for the 
delineation of neurodegenerative disease processes, we still lack a full 
understanding of the pathologic mechanisms of these diseases, resulting in few 
appropriate treatment options and diagnostic challenges. To mitigate these gaps, 
the Neurodegenerative Disease Knowledge Portal (NDKP) was created as an 
open-science initiative with the aim to aggregate, enable analysis, and display 
all available genomic datasets of neurodegenerative disease, while protecting 
the integrity and confidentiality of the underlying datasets. The portal 
contains 218 genomic datasets, including genotyping and sequencing studies, of 
individuals across 10 different phenotypic groups, including neurologic 
conditions such as Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body 
dementia, and Parkinson disease. In addition to securely hosting large genomic 
datasets, the NDKP provides accessible workflows and tools to effectively use 
the datasets and assist in the facilitation of customized genomic analyses. 
Here, we summarize the genomic datasets currently included within the portal, 
the bioinformatics processing of the datasets, and the variety of phenotypes 
captured. We also present example use cases of the various user interfaces and 
integrated analytic tools to demonstrate their extensive utility in enabling the 
extraction of high-quality results at the source, for both genomics experts and 
those in other disciplines. Overall, the NDKP promotes open science and 
collaboration, maximizing the potential for discovery from the large-scale 
datasets researchers and consortia are expending immense resources to produce 
and resulting in reproducible conclusions to improve diagnostic and therapeutic 
care for patients with neurodegenerative disease.

Central nervous system disorders are likely to have a substantial effect on the 
worldwide healthcare demands of humanity in this era. Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
is a senile decay of neurons. Extracellular beta-amyloid accumulation and 
intracellular tau hyperphosphorylation are two key characteristics of the 
pathogenesis of AD. Because of the multifactorial character of many disorders, 
new medicine-based psychoactive treatments have had limited success. As a 
result, there is a growing demand for innovative products that can target 
different receptors and improve behavioral abilities on their own or in 
combination with established treatments. In recent years, both industrialized 
and developing countries have seen a surge in herbal products based on 
traditional knowledge. According to recent research, bacoside and its congeners 
can dramatically lower the build-up of amyloid-β plaques, which are a defining 
feature of AD. This decrease is explained by bacoside's capacity to regulate 
β-secretase activity, which lowers the production of amyloid-β. Ayurveda is a 
medical science that focuses on the use of naturally occurring plant products to 
treat ailments. Many neuroprotective plants are said to be found in Ayurveda. 
The key physiological dysfunctions linked to tau aggregates, which contribute to 
dementia and behavioral inconsistencies, include the formation of reactive 
oxygen species, augmented neuronal swelling, and neurotoxicity. Here, we have 
focused on bacopa as an anti-Alzheimer medication. Bacoside A, Baccoside B, 
Apigenin, Betullinic acid, etc. are the pharmacologically active congeners of 
Brahmi belonging to several chemical families. In this review, the 
neuroprotective properties, pharmacological effectiveness, and molecular 
mechanism of bacoside scaffolds against AD have been discussed.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined the association of longitudinal atrophy with 
baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ, A) and phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau, T) biomarkers (Aβ42/40, p-tau181) in 406 cognitively unimpaired (CU) 
individuals (6.670 years of follow-up on average, up to 13 imaging visits) to 
assess whether A+ is associated with Alzheimer's disease-like atrophy and 
whether this depends on p-tau181 levels.
METHODS: An A-T- CU group free from abnormal neurodegeneration (N) was 
identified using a robust normative approach and used to model normal 
age-related atrophy via z-scoring. Linear mixed-effects models tested 
differences in longitudinal atrophy between A+ and A-T-N- individuals and 
between A/T subgroups.
RESULTS: A+ was associated with worse atrophy within and beyond the medial 
temporal lobe, even at low levels of p-tau181.
DISCUSSION: Neurodegeneration likely begins soon after the onset of abnormal Aβ 
pathology. Clinical intervention at the earliest signs of Aβ pathology may be 
needed to mitigate further neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: An A-T-N- control group was identified using a robust normative 
approachA+ was associated with accelerated atrophy in cognitively unimpaired 
individualsAtrophy was observed even at low p-tau181 levels.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the association between plasma 
amyloid-β oligomerization tendency (OAβ) and cognitive performance in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and determine its predictive value for outcomes of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Plasma from 727 subjects (286 AD, 260 MCI, and 181 controls) in a case 
registry was analyzed using the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure 
plasma OAβ.
RESULTS: Elevated plasma OAβ was strongly correlated with multidomain cognitive 
performance in patients with MCI and AD. Patients with MCI with high baseline 
plasma OAβ demonstrated a higher risk of progressing to dementia (hazard 
ratio = 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.032-1.137). Baseline plasma OAβ 
effectively predicted MCI-dementia conversion (area under the curve 
[AUC] = 0.824, 95% CI 0.752-0.897).
DISCUSSION: The real-world findings underscore the clinical relevance of plasma 
OAβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) to dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: We recruit study participants of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal controls in a case 
registry.We use the multimer detection system (MDS) to measure plasma amyloid-β 
oligomerization tendency (OAβ).We observe that elevated plasma OAβ strongly 
correlates with multidomain cognitive performance in patients with MCI and 
AD.MCI individuals with high baseline plasma OAβ demonstrate a higher risk of 
progressing to dementia.The real-world findings underscore the clinical 
relevance of plasma Oaβ as a potential predictor for the conversion from MCI to 
dementia.

Ghrelin is a class of brain and intestinal peptides. It regulates food intake 
and body glucose levels and maintains cellular homeostasis. In recent years, 
research has revealed that ghrelin may positively impact learning and memory. 
Despite ghrelin's multiple functions in the central nervous system, its use as a 
therapeutic agent for neurologic dysfunction remains unclear. Diabetic cognitive 
impairment (DCI) is a severe neurological complication of diabetes mellitus. Its 
incidence is increasing as a comorbidity in endocrinology and neurology. 
Additionally, it is a risk factor for Alzheimer' s disease (AD). Ghrelin levels 
are altered in patients with diabetes mellitus combined with cognitive 
impairment. Furthermore, modulation of ghrelin levels improved cognitive 
function in rats with DCI. These findings suggest the potential therapeutic 
importance of ghrelin in the pathogenesis of DCI. This article presents a 
comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of DCI and its potential modulation by 
ghrelin and its mimics. Furthermore, this study elucidates the therapeutic 
prospects of ghrelin and its mimics for DCI, aiming to identify novel 
therapeutic targets and research avenues for the prevention and management of 
DCI in the future.

In the last 5 years significant progress has been made in potential dementia 
treatments, yet many of these treatments come with significant burdens on the 
healthcare system that may limit access to treatment and care for patients. 
Often patients in remote and rural regions and those in low income regions are 
disadvantaged. Many clinical trials for dementia patients are biased to 
recruiting a homogenous group of patients that does not represent cultural and 
linguistic diversity, meaning the generalisability of trials is limited. This 
viewpoint discusses the barriers to access to early treatments and clinical 
trials for patients with dementia and offers a potential framework to address 
these including provision of infrastructure, regulatory change and patient 
education.

BACKGROUND: Deep learning (DL) technologies are playing increasingly important 
roles in computer-aided diagnosis in medicine. In this study, we sought to 
address issues related to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on 
multi-modal features, and introduced a multi-modal three-dimensional 
Inception-v4 model that employs transfer learning for AD diagnosis based on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical score data.
METHODS: The multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) Inception-v4 model was first 
pre-trained using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Subsequently, independent validation data were used to 
fine-tune the model with pre-trained weight parameters. The model was 
quantitatively evaluated using the mean values obtained from five-fold 
cross-validation. Further, control experiments were conducted to verify the 
performance of the model patients with AD, and in the study of disease 
progression.
RESULTS: In the AD diagnosis task, when a single image marker was used, the 
average accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC) were 62.21% and 71.87%, 
respectively. When transfer learning was not employed, the average ACC and AUC 
were 75.74% and 83.13%, respectively. Conversely, the combined approach proposed 
in this study achieved an average ACC of 87.84%, and an average AUC of 90.80% 
[with an average precision (PRE) of 87.21%, an average recall (REC) of 82.52%, 
and an average F1 of 83.58%].
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with existing methods, the performance of the 
proposed method was superior in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, the 
method showed an enhanced ability to accurately distinguish among various stages 
of AD. Our findings show that multi-modal feature fusion and transfer learning 
can be valuable resources in the treatment of patients with AD, and in the study 
of disease progression.

Years of experience watching our patients progressively decline and die from 
complications of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has strongly motivated us to provide 
newly approved anti-amyloid treatments to appropriate patients. Following 
detailed and personalized discussions of the potential risks and benefits of 
these treatments with patients and their families, almost 300 patients at our 
clinic have chosen to receive lecanemab infusions. We have found the frequency 
and severity of complications, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
(ARIA), to be manageable and as expected based on clinical trials. While the 
longer-term benefits of these treatments are not yet clear, our patients and 
their families are accepting of even a modest slowing of disease progression. We 
have experienced the complexities, burdens, costs, and major logistical 
challenges associated with the treatment of AD with anti-amyloid treatments. 
However, we also understand that for some of our current patients with early 
symptomatic AD, anti-amyloid treatments are their best option for fighting this 
devastating disease, and we find it worthwhile to provide these treatments to 
our patients.
HIGHLIGHTS: Many of our former patients have died from complications of AD.Our 
clinic now has nearly 300 patients receiving anti-amyloid treatments.We have 
found the complications of anti-amyloid treatments to be manageable.Despite the 
challenges, we find anti-amyloid treatments worthwhile.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative condition 
distinguished by the occurrence of memory impairment, cognitive deterioration, 
and neuronal impairment. Despite extensive research efforts, conventional 
treatment strategies primarily focus on symptom management, highlighting the 
need for innovative therapeutic approaches. This review explores the challenges 
of AD treatment and the integration of computational methodologies to advance 
therapeutic interventions. A comprehensive analysis of recent literature was 
conducted to elucidate the broad scope of Alzheimer's etiology and the 
limitations of conventional drug discovery approaches. Our findings underscore 
the critical role of computational models in elucidating disease mechanisms, 
identifying therapeutic targets, and expediting drug discovery. Through 
computational simulations, researchers can predict drug efficacy, optimize lead 
compounds, and facilitate personalized medicine approaches. Moreover, machine 
learning algorithms enhance early diagnosis and enable precision medicine 
strategies by analyzing multi-modal datasets. Case studies highlight the 
application of computational techniques in AD therapeutics, including the 
suppression of crucial proteins implicated in disease progression and the 
repurposing of existing drugs for AD management. Computational models elucidate 
the interplay between oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, offering insights 
into potential therapeutic interventions. Collaborative efforts between 
computational biologists, pharmacologists, and clinicians are essential to 
translate computational insights into clinically actionable interventions, 
ultimately improving patient outcomes and addressing the unmet medical needs of

Solanesol (Sol) and chlorogenic acid (CHA) are naturally active compounds. Sol 
exhibits a significant free radical absorption ability and strong antioxidant 
activity. CHA, a typical phenolic acid, exhibits excellent anticancer, 
anti-inflammation, and antibacterial properties. Herein, bifunctional 
nanomicelles (CI@SPK) were skillfully designed to take advantage of the unique 
properties of Sol and CHA to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hydrophobic Sol was 
modified with poly(ethylene glycol) to self-assemble into stable nanomicelles 
(SP). CHA could be encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of these nanomicelles, 
which increased its bioavailability greatly. Short peptide K (CKLVFFAED) was 
incorporated (CI@SPK) to facilitate their crossing the blood-brain barrier. 
Then, CI@SPK targeted the AD lesion area, and CHA was released in greater 
quantities with the help of IR780 under irradiation with an 808 nm laser, 
resulting in synergistically scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) with Sol. 
Consequently, the nanomicelles CI@SPK demonstrated capabilities in scavenging 
ROS, inhibiting β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, and eventually modulating microglia 
phenotype from M1 to M2 to promote Aβ phagocytosis and clearance. In vivo 
studies indicated that nanomicelles CI@SPK improved the learning and cognitive 
impairments of APP/PS1 mice by reducing Aβ plaque and inflammation, signifying 
the potential value of CI@SPK in clinical application for AD treatment.

The dysfunction of different cells lies in the pathogenesis of neurological 
diseases and is usually associated with cellular stress. Various stressors 
trigger the integrated stress response (ISR) signaling, whose highly conserved 
mechanism is primarily aimed at protecting a stress-exposed cell to cope as 
safely as possible with such stressful conditions. On the contrary, if a cell is 
unable to cope with excessive stress, the ISR can induce apoptosis. The ISR 
mechanism, whose main stage is the inhibition of translation machinery in favor 
of the synthesis of specific proteins, including the transcription factors ATF3, 
ATF4, CEBPA, and CEBPB, which function only as dimers and determine the 
uniqueness of the ISR response in each individual case, thus ensures different 
outcomes of the ISR. Inhibition of global protein synthesis is achieved through 
phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK, HRI, PKR, or GCN2. To date, a number of 
compounds have been developed that modulate the ISR, including activators and 
inhibitors of the abovementioned ISR kinases as well as modulators of p-eIF2α 
dephosphorylation. They target different ISR stages, allowing a broad ISR 
modulation strategy. At the same time, there are no drugs that are both 
exceptionally safe and effective for the treatment of several neurological 
diseases, so there is an urgent need for new approaches to the treatment of 
these disorders. In this review, we represent ISR signaling as an important 
participant in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. We also describe how 
various ISR modulators may become a part of future therapies for these diseases.

BackgroundThe prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing, and with it 
comes the demand for specialized services. Current information on the 
institutionalization of patients with AD is limited.ObjectiveTo determine the 
level of institutionalization among AD patients in the facilities of the Czech 
Republic and the Slovak Republic.MethodsA survey of the rate of 
institutionalization in facilities in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. 
The survey collects data on the institutionalization of patients suffering from 
AD in relation to the capacity of the facilities and the prevalence of the 
disease. Data were collected by representative quantitative survey, during years 
2019-2021.ResultsPatients with AD occupy approximately 25% of the total 
capacities of institutions in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The rate of 
institutionalization of patients with AD is estimated at 20.5% in the Czech 
Republic and 24% in the Slovak Republic. This is more than the estimated 
worldwide rate of institutionalization of people with AD (16%) but less than the 
estimated rate of institutionalization of these patients in high-income 
countries (31%).ConclusionsAs the prevalence of AD increases, so do the demands 
for care. If there is no increase in institutional capacity, this growth will 
put more pressure on home care. In order to provide specialized care to as many 
patients as possible, emphasis must be placed on increasing the capacity of 
institutions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder for which 
there are currently rarely effective drug treatments available to halt or slow 
down its progression. With the aging of the world population, AD as the primary 
cause of dementia, is rapidly becoming one of the most expensive, lethal, and 
burdening diseases of this century. In recent years, the new method used to 
treat nervous system diseases including AD is transcranial electrical 
stimulation (tES) with non-invasive and for regulating the flexibility of neural 
circuits operation and behaviors. The rationale of tES for AD neuromodulation is 
derived from research on animal and clinical trials. In the present paper, we 
review the current uses of the tES including transcranial direct current 
stimulation, transcranial alternating current stimulation, and transcranial 
pulsed electrical stimulation in rehabilitation for AD's core clinical symptom 
with cognitive dysfunctions, as well as the relevant data from AD animal models 
have also been discussed. Finally, the regarding applied challenges of tES in AD 
therapy have been referred for further improvement.

BACKGROUND: Non-invasive brain stimulation has shown positive results in 
maximizing the effects of language therapy in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). 
Due to the different patterns of brain damage in each aphasia variant, we 
hypothesized that patients with non-fluent and semantic variants would show a 
differential response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the clinical responses after a single session of 
repetitive TMS in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC).
METHODOLOGY: Twenty patients with PPA (14 with non-fluent and 6 with semantic 
variants) were assessed before and after repetitive TMS over the IFG, DLPC, and 
vertex with several language tasks, connected speech, and a subjective 
impression of change scale.
RESULTS: IFG stimulation was associated with an improvement in words per minute 
and the subjective assessment in the non-fluent variant, but no effects were 
found in the semantic variant. DLPC stimulation was associated with an 
improvement in words per minute, repetition, and naming latency in the 
non-fluent variant, and in naming and subjective impression of change in the 
semantic variant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a differential effect of one session of brain 
stimulation over the IFG and DLPC in patients with non-fluent and semantic PPA 
variants. These findings suggest that the selection of the target of stimulation 
may be relevant for the success of brain stimulation and favor the use of DLPC 
over the IFG.

BackgroundCuriosity and decentering are two constructs that represent momentary 
mindfulness. Dance is an art and complex physical activity mode, which may serve 
as a behavioral correlate of mindfulness.ObjectiveTo characterize momentary 
mindfulness in relation to a novel, accelerometer-derived measure for 
characterizing human movement quality (i.e. "dance-like state" DLS 
scores).MethodsAdults (N = 41), ages 18-83 years old, engaged in the following 
conditions in a lab and completed questionnaires on mindfulness after each: (1) 
clipping their fingernails; (2) sitting, standing, and walking on a treadmill; 
and (3) dancing at self-determined reference intensities with and without music. 
Conditions 2-3 were monitored with accelerometers. DLS score summary statistics 
(i.e. median and median amplitude deviation [MAD]) were used in linear mixed 
effects models.ResultsOn average, curiosity [13.7(1.02)] was significantly 
associated with median DLS scores (β = 1.79, p = 0.007) over time; adults with a 
lower median DLS score reported higher levels of curiosity [16.2; 95%C.I. 
13.3-19.0], on average, when compared [12.6; 95%C.I., 10.3-14.9] to adults with 
a higher median DLS score. On average, decentering [14.9(1.01)] was 
significantly associated with the DLS score MAD (β = 1.28, p = 0.035) over time; 
adults who had less variability in DLS scores across conditions reported greater 
experiences of decentering [15.9; 95%C.I. 13.7-18.1], on average, when compared 
[13.3; 95%C.I. 10.7-15.9] to adults with more variability in DLS scores across 
conditions.ConclusionsAmong ostensibly healthy adults, movement quality was 
correlated with momentary mindfulness. Additional research is needed to 
understand if DLS scores are differentially associated with momentary 
mindfulness among adults with Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Molecular biomarkers of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are 
lacking. We evaluated 18F-MK-6240 tau PET as a biomarker for CTE. Two studies 
were done: (1) 3H-MK-6240 autoradiography and an in-vitro brain homogenate 
binding studies on postmortem CTE tissue, (2) an in-vivo 18F-MK-6240 tau PET 
study in former American football players.
METHODS: Autoradiography and in-vitro binding studies were done using 3H-MK-6240 
on frozen temporal and frontal cortex tissue from six autopsy cases with stage 
III CTE compared to Alzheimer's disease. Thirty male former National Football 
League (NFL) players with cognitive concerns (mean age = 58.9, SD = 7.8) 
completed tau (18F-MK-6240) and Aβ (18F-Florbetapir) PET. Controls included 39 
Aβ-PET negative, cognitively normal males (mean age = 65.7, SD = 6.3). 
18F-MK-6240 SUVr images were created using 70-90 min post-injection data with 
inferior cerebellar gray matter as the reference. We compared SUVr between 
players and controls using voxelwise and region-of-interest approaches. 
Correlations between 18F-MK-6240 SUVr and cognitive scores were tested.
RESULTS: All six CTE stage III cases had Braak NFT stage III but no neuritic 
plaques. Two had Thal Phase 1 for Aβ; one showed a laminar pattern of 3H-MK-6240 
autoradiography binding in the superior temporal cortex and less so in the 
dorsolateral frontal cortex, corresponding to tau-immunoreactive lesions 
detected using the AT8 antibody (pSer202/pThr205 tau) in adjacent tissue 
sections. The other CTE cases had low frequencies of cortical tau-immunoreactive 
deposits and no well-defined autoradiography binding. In-vitro 3H-MK-6240 
binding studies to CTE brain homogenates in the case with autoradiography signal 
indicated high binding affinity (KD = 2.0 ± 0.9 nM, Bmax = 97 ± 24 nM, n = 3). 
All NFL players had negative Aβ-PET. There was variable, low-to-intermediate 
intensity 18F-MK-6240 uptake across participants: 16 had no cortical signal, 7 
had medial temporal lobe (MTL) uptake, 2 had frontal uptake, and 4 had MTL and 
frontal uptake. NFL players had higher SUVr in the entorhinal cortex (d = 0.86, 
p = 0.001), and the parahippocampal gyrus (d = 0.39, p = 0.08). Voxelwise 
regressions showed increased uptake in NFL players in two bilateral anterior MTL 
clusters (p < 0.05 FWE). Higher parahippocampal and frontal-temporal SUVrs 
correlated with worse memory (r = -0.38, r = -0.40) and semantic fluency 
(r = -0.38, r = -0.48), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We present evidence of 3H-MK-6240 in-vitro binding to post-mortem 
CTE tissue homogenates and in vivo 18F-MK-6240 PET binding in the MTL among a 
subset of participants. Additional studies in larger samples and PET-to-autopsy 
correlations are required to further elucidate the potential of 18F-MK-6240 to 
detect tau pathology in CTE.

The number of people living with dementia is expected to rise to 153 million 
cases globally by 2050. This will come at a high economic and human cost to 
societies with disproportionate effects on socioeconomically disadvantaged 
groups who experience greater exposures to- and fewer protections from- the 
environmental, social and behavioural drivers of dementia risk. Almost half 
(45%) of dementia incidence could theoretically be prevented or delayed by 
addressing 14 modifiable risk factors. While several studies have demonstrated 
the feasibility of multidomain dementia risk reduction interventions in 
relatively older, educated and wealthy populations, we are not aware of any 
studies to date explicitly targeting younger adults (< 50 years) with lower 
socioeconomic status. To inform future strategies, we conducted a scoping review 
of intervention studies targeting multiple 'dementia-related' risk factors among 
adults with lower socioeconomic status in developed country contexts. We 
identified 1003 unique records; 34 met our criteria for inclusion - involving 
more than 17,500 participants from 13 countries. While none of the studies 
explicitly targeted dementia risk reduction, they reported on 30 relevant 
multidomain interventions targeting common risk factors associated with dementia 
including; diet (28), physical inactivity (27), obesity (22), diabetes (9), 
hypertension (8), smoking (6), alcohol use (6), depression (3) and social 
isolation (1). While most studies recorded positive effects on one or more 
health behaviours, there was a diversity in the design, approach and outcomes of 
interventions, with significant intervention effects being associated with the 
use of a wider range of behaviour change techniques. We suggest that designing 
interventions to reduce dementia risk and disparities requires a high degree of 
contextual specificity and propose a structured and participatory approach.

This review discusses findings related to neurological disorders, gut 
microbiota, and bariatric surgery, focusing on neurotransmitters, 
neuroendocrine, the pathophysiology of bacteria contributing to disorders, and 
possible therapeutic interventions. Research on neurotransmitters suggests that 
their levels are heavily influenced by gut microbiota, which may link them to 
neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Multiple sclerosis, Depression, and Autism spectrum disorder. The 
pathophysiology of bacteria that reach and influence the central nervous system 
has been documented. Trends in microbiota are often observed in specific 
neurological disorders, with a prominence of pro-inflammatory bacteria and a 
reduction in anti-inflammatory types. Furthermore, bariatric surgery has been 
shown to alter microbiota profiles similar to those observed in neurological 
disorders. Therapeutic interventions, including fecal microbiota transplants and 
probiotics, have shown potential to alleviate neurological symptoms. We suggest 
a framework for future studies that integrates knowledge from diverse research 
areas, employs rigorous methodologies, and includes long-trial clinical control 
groups.

BACKGROUND: Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS) is a classic Chinese medicine formula that 
has been extensively studied for its efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, its mechanism of action is still unclear.
METHODS: In this study, UHPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS was used to analyze and 
identify the compounds in DSS. Network pharmacology was used to analyze the 
common targets of drug-containing serum chemistries and AD, as well as the AD 
pathways in which drug-containing serum chemistries may be involved. The 
27-OHC-induced SH-SY5Y/C6 coculture cell injury model was used to explore the 
mechanism of action of DSS in the treatment of AD.
RESULTS: UHPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS analysis identified 73 chemical 
constituents in DSS aqueous extract and 39 compounds in drug-containing serum. 
According to network pharmacology analysis, DSS and AD share 181 common targets, 
with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) being the main 
effective targets. Furthermore, DSS may treat AD through the modulation of lipid 
metabolism-related pathways and the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway. 
27-hydroxycholesterol acid (27-OHC) significantly reduced the viability of 
SH-SY5Y cells and C6 cells in vitro, while DSS administration upregulated the 
expression of cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) and cytochrome P450 7B1 (CYP7B1) 
enzymes and reduced cholesterol levels in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, DSS 
decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and increased glutathione (GSH) 
levels in coculture systems. DSS downregulated the expression of IL-17 in 
27-OHC-injured SH-SY5Y cells and downregulated the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and 
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in 27-OHC-injured C6 cells.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the effective components, targets and mechanisms 
of DSS in the treatment of AD, highlighting the significant potential of DSS in 
treating this disease.

Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is an early presymptomatic manifestation of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), with symptom-free periods of varying duration that 
likely reflect individual differences in metabolic resilience. We propose a 
systemic "bioenergetic capacity", the individual ability to maintain energy 
homeostasis under pathological conditions. Using fasting serum acylcarnitine 
profiles from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative as a blood-based readout for this 
capacity, we identified subgroups with distinct clinical and biomarker 
presentations of AD. Our data suggests that improving beta-oxidation efficiency 
can decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. The estimated 
treatment effects of targeting the bioenergetic capacity were comparable to 
those of recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, particularly in individuals 
with specific mitochondrial genotypes linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism. 
Taken together, our findings provide evidence that therapeutically enhancing 
bioenergetic health may reduce the risk of symptomatic AD. Furthermore, 
monitoring the bioenergetic capacity via blood acylcarnitine measurements can be 
achieved using existing clinical assays.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often experience mental and memory 
disorders with poor outcomes. Coenzyme Q10 can degrade formaldehyde (FA) and 
improve Alzheimer-related symptoms, but its ability to cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) is limited. This study investigated whether low-intensity pulsed 
ultrasound (LIPUS) enhances 30 nm Q10 delivery and improve symptoms in AD model 
mice. Here, 30 nm Q10 was prepared by encapsulating Q10 in liposomes coupled 
with PEG, creating PEG-Q10@NPs under 30 nm in diameter. Wild-type mice and 
APPswe/PS1dE9 mice (a familial AD model) received 30 nm Q10 via intraperitoneal 
injection, or a combination of 30 nm Q10 and LIPUS (50 or 100 100 mW/cm2). Then 
the mice's anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors and biochemical index were 
evaluated. We found that the combination therapy of LIPUS at 100 mW/cm2 and 
30 nm Q10 was more effective in ameliorating psychosis in AD mice than 
individual treatments with 30 nm Q10. This effectiveness was linked to higher 
levels of brain Q10, serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA), along with lower 
levels of FA and plaques. Especially, excessive FA directly inactivated 5-HT and 
DA in vitro. The enhanced cellular uptake of Q10 and improved BBB permeability 
facilitated by LIPUS were confirmed in both cultured cells and wild-type mice. 
Unexpectedly, LIPUS at the different intensity only partially alleviated anxiety 
and depression symptoms and memory deficits in AD mice. Hence, this combination 
therapy of LIPUS and 30 nm Q10 is an innovative strategy for ameliorating mental 
and cognitive disorders in AD.

Metallothionein (MT) is a small-molecule protein that functions in essential 
trace element homeostasis. Among MT isoforms, MT3 is involved in neuronal 
activity, and its expression is reported to be decreased in patients with 
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease; however, only a few 
effective drugs have been reported to induce MT3 expression. In this study, we 
evaluated existing drugs for the induction of MT3 expression in the neuronal 
cell line of ReNcell CX cells. Using recombinant proteins of MT isoforms with 
the 3× Flag tag, we performed Western blotting (WB) with the primary antibodies 
against MT3 or Flag tag, and this method of WB for MT3 was confirmed 
specifically to detect the MT3 protein. We treated ReNcell CX cells with several 
HIF-PH inhibitors and evaluated MT3 expression via real-time RT-PCR. We found 
that FG4592 significantly enhanced MT3 expression at both RNA and protein 
levels. FG4592 treatment increased the amount of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 
alpha (HIF1α) binding to the MT3 promoter. These findings indicate that FG4592 
induces MT3 expression via increased HIF1α. In conclusion, we found FG4592 to be 
an endogenous MT3 inducer in the cells of the nervous system in this study. The 
findings of this study are expected to lead to the development of new 
MT3-inducing drugs for neurodegenerative diseases based on FG4592.

OBJECTIVE: Examine the association of household ties with diabetes awareness and 
self-care behaviors among Hispanic/Latinos.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study 
of Latinos were used (Visit 2; 2014-2017; n = 11,071). Household ties (none, 
extended, and close), sex, and loneliness were used in a cluster analysis to 
derive the household clusters. Diabetes awareness and diabetes self-care 
behaviors (among the aware only) were the outcomes.
RESULTS: Clusters that emerged were:(1) Females who rarely feel lonely and who 
mostly live with close ties; (2) Males who rarely feel lonely and who mostly 
live with close ties; (3) Males and females who feel lonely despite living with 
mostly close ties; (4)Males and females who feel lonely and mostly live alone or 
without familial ties. Cluster 4 had the highest proportion of diagnosed (27%) 
and undiagnosed diabetes (10%). In regression models, none of the clusters 
related to diabetes awareness. However, among the aware, glucose monitoring was 
only significantly higher among cluster 1 relative to cluster 4. Compared to 
cluster 4, all clusters were significantly more likely to know their HbA1c.
CONCLUSIONS: Household tie clusters were related to diabetes self-care behavior 
but not awareness.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious, irreversible, complex 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and 
memory loss; affecting millions worldwide. Despite decades of research, no 
effective disease-modifying treatment exists. However, drug repurposing is a 
progressive step in identifying new therapeutic uses of existing drugs. It has 
emerged as a promising strategy in the quest to combat AD. Various classes of 
repurposed drugs, such as antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antimicrobial, and 
anti-inflammatory, have shown potential neuroprotective effects in preclinical 
and clinical studies. These drugs act by combating free radicals generation, 
neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta aggregation, and tau hyper-phosphorylation. 
Furthermore, repurposing offers several advantages, including reduced time and 
cost compared to de novo drug development. It holds immense promise as a 
complementary approach to traditional drug discovery. Future research efforts 
should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of repurposed drugs in AD, 
optimizing drug combinations, and conducting large-scale clinical trials to 
validate their efficacy and safety profiles. This review overviews recent 
advancements and findings in preclinical and clinical fields of different 
repurposed drugs for AD treatment.

Toxic oligomers of amyloid-β (Aβ) are important in the pathology of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and degradation of Aβ oligomers (AβO) in the brain is considered a 
promising strategy for drug development. However, conventional drug screening 
techniques face challenges in the rapid and real-time assessment of AβO. Here, 
we report a simple and reliable nanocollision electrochemical method based on 
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) "tagging" that can in situ monitor Aβ 
oligomerization and screen potential AβO-degrading drugs. The differences in 
collision signals between AgNPs-Aβ complexes and AgNPs were compared to achieve 
rapid identification of Aβ complexes with different aggregation degrees. The 
degradation effect following the addition of AβO-degrading drugs can be quickly 
evaluated by the recovery of collision frequency (f, number of peaks per unit 
time), which is effective if f > 0.15. Degradation efficiency was further 
quantified using current lifetimes (τ, the time required for the current to 
decay to 1/e of the original), based on the percentage of τ ≤ 10 ms. The 
practicability of the method was tested using Aβ-degrading protease and several 
small molecules, confirming the rapid screening of AβO-degrading drugs and 
offering a novel strategy to accelerate the development of drugs for AD 
treatment.

Cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are highly prevalent and 
place heavy burdens on society. Neuroinflammation is a driver of cognitive 
impairment, with no effective drugs. Indole 3-propionic acid (IPA) is a 
tryptophan metabolite mainly produced byClostridium sporogenes, which exhibits 
multiple functions, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiaging, and 
neuroprotective properties. However, the restorative effects and molecular 
mechanisms of IPA in cognitive impairment remain to be investigated. In this 
study, we found that IPA reduced LPS-induced apoptosis and oxidative damage in 
HT22 cells and decreased LPS-induced inflammation in BV2 cells. Besides, IPA 
promoted neurogenesis, inhibited glial cell activation, maintained the integrity 
of the BBB and intestinal barrier, and remodeled the gut microbiota, thereby 
alleviating memory impairment in LPS-induced cognitively impaired mice. At the 
mechanistic level, IPA inhibited the RAGE-JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway and thus 
ameliorated neuroinflammation. Interestingly, Colivelin TFA, an activator of 
JAK2-STAT3 signaling, partially reversed the neurorestorative effects of IPA. In 
conclusion, IPA ameliorates neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits via the 
inhibition of the RAGE-JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Thus, IPA may be a 
potential drug for the treatment of cognitive disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Modifiable risk factors, particularly those in midlife, can 
contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Despite this, the 'how' of 
dementia risk reduction, including the application of interventional and care 
frameworks to deliver such a program is lacking. Our aim was to describe the 
'how' in clinical delivery of a dementia risk reduction program called 
BetterBrains.
METHODS: BetterBrains is an online, person-centred risk factor management 
program designed to prevent or delay cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired 
community-dwelling, middle-aged adults with a family history of dementia. This 
protocol describes the delivery and implementation of BetterBrains using the 
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework.
RESULTS: Procedures for risk factor assessment and tailored management pathways 
using motivational interviewing, nationwide community linkage mapping and 
community referral pathways using digital delivery are outlined. Coach training 
and competency checks for program fidelity measures are also described.
CONCLUSION: Complex, multi-component programs require detailed implementation 
processes. Clinicians delivering BetterBrains may be better supported through 
standardised operating procedures, training and monitoring of competencies and 
implementation fidelity.

Pronounced elevation of glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma B (GPNMB) is a 
common phenomenon in a variety of brain diseases, but the expression patterns, 
functions, and molecular signaling of GPNMB have not been well studied. Here, we 
showed that pathological factors, including neuronal degeneration caused by 
seizures, caspase-3-induced neuronal apoptosis, neuronal debris, and β-amyloid, 
induced "on-demand" GPNMB expression in hippocampal microglia. Genetic ablation 
of GPNMB did not affect acute seizures but worsened chronic epileptogenesis. We 
found that GPNMB functioned in phagocytosis, deficiency of which resulted in 
defects in both phagocytic engulfment and degradation. GPNMB could be 
internalized into cells, where it wrapped engulfed pathogenic particles and 
presented them to lysosomes through interaction with lysosomal vacuolar-type 
proton ATPase catalytic subunit A (ATP6V1A). Activating ATP6V1A was able to 
rescue GPNMB-deficiency-caused phagocytosis impairment. Thus, microglial 
GPNMB-ATP6V1A might be a common treatment target of a batch of chronic 
neurological disorders, and clearing the degenerative neurons might be more 
valuable than reserving them to protect the brain.

Alzheimer's disease is linked with diabetes and cancer, emphasising the need for 
effective treatments. Plantago lanceolata, recognised as safe by various 
pharmacopeias, was investigated in this study for therapeutic potential. We 
examined the effects of its leaf extracts and sub-extracts (methanol, hexane, 
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol, aqueous) on AChE, BChE, α-amylase, 
α-glucosidase enzymes, as well as their impact on HDF-a and U87-MG cancer cells. 
The phytochemical characterisation was performed using ICP-MS and LC-MS/MS. 
Cytotoxic effects were evaluated on HDF-a and U87-MG cell lines, along with 
assessments for nuclear abnormalities. Na and K were detected in extracts, with 
isoleucine and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside being the most concentrated compounds. 
Extracts at concentrations exceeding 25 µg/mL significantly increased 
cytotoxicity in HDF-a cell lines compared to the control group, without inducing 
nuclear abnormalities. Methanol extract demonstrated moderate inhibition against 
AChE and BChE at concentrations of 100 µg/mL and 500 µg/mL, respectively. These 
findings suggest that extracts exhibit potential therapeutic effects.

As the world population ages, new molecular targets in aging and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) are needed to combat the expected influx of new AD cases. Until 
now, the role of RNA structure in aging and neurodegeneration has largely 
remained unexplored. In this study, we examined human hippocampal postmortem 
tissue for the formation of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in aging and AD. We found 
that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in the hippocampus with both age and 
with AD severity. We further found that neurons with the accumulation of 
phospho-tau immunostaining contained rG4s, rG4 structure can drive tau 
aggregation, and rG4 staining density depended on APOE genotype in the human 
tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 
structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we 
propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation is linked to 
proteostasis collapse. These morphological findings suggest that further 
investigation of RNA structure in neurodegeneration is a critical avenue for 
future treatments and diagnoses.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that remains challenging 
to treat. Akt and Wnt play a role in complex cellular signaling, which is 
crucial for examining the onset of AD. In this study, we aimed to identify and 
analyze Akt pathway-related genes (ARGs) and Wnt pathway-related genes (WRGs) as 
AD biomarkers, determine the effects of ARGs and WRGs on AD, and verify these 
effects in AD mouse models. We searched for differentially expressed genes in 
the Gene Expression Omnibus database, constructed candidate gene protein-protein 
interaction networks, and used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression analysis and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination 
algorithm to screen key genes. Correlation and functional similarity analyses of 
key genes, immune infiltration analysis, competing endogenous RNA network 
construction, and drug prediction of key genes were performed. Expression of key 
genes in streptozotocin-treated (STZ)-treated AD mice was validated using 
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). 
Bioinformatics analysis identified five key genes in AD: PRKACA, CDH3, ATP6V0C, 
DLL1, and CELSR2. Step-down tests, immunohistochemistry, and silver plate 
staining confirmed successful treatment of STZ-induced AD in mice. According to 
RT-qPCR analysis, the relative expression of DLL1 mRNA in AD mice was higher 
than that in control mice, whereas the relative expression of ATP6V0C and PRKACA 
mRNA in AD mice was lower than that in control mice; this was consistent with 
the results of bioinformatics analysis (p < 0.05). This study screened and 
validated AD biomarkers associated with the Akt and Wnt pathways in mouse 
models.

INTRODUCTION: The increasing prevalence of dementia in aging populations 
necessitates effective and accessible cognitive screening tools. This study 
aimed to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a newly developed mobile 
app for detecting and screening mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The mobile app, developed by LifeQuest Co., Ltd. (Minato-ku, Tokyo), is 
an original tool inspired by the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA-J). A prospective observational study was conducted with 20 
participants, including healthy individuals, MCI patients, and those with mild 
to moderate-severe dementia. Participants completed both the mobile app and the 
MoCA-J in a randomized order within a two-week period, with a minimum one-day 
interval between tests.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the 
mobile app and the MoCA-J was 0.956 (95% CI: 0.89-0.983), demonstrating a very 
high level of correlation. All participants successfully completed the mobile 
app assessment, highlighting its feasibility across various cognitive levels. 
Although minor technical issues and usability challenges were identified, the 
results support the mobile app as a reliable and user-friendly alternative for 
cognitive screening. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to 
validate these findings and refine the app for broader clinical use.

PURPOSE: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is one of the strongest genetic 
determinants of the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
may also increase the risk of cancer. However, its importance goes far beyond 
this. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the potential role 
and prognostic value of APOE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using 
bioinformatics and multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mIHC).
METHODS: Clinicopathologic samples from 90 hCC patients enrolled between April 
2007 and June 2012 were included in this study. Researchers used tissue 
microarrays (HLiv180Su09) and multiple fluorescent immunohistochemical analyses 
to validate APOE protein expression and patient prognosis. Several online 
databases were used to investigate APOE expression and prognosis in HCC, 
followed by a comprehensive analysis of correlations between APOE and 
clinicopathologic features, immune cell infiltration levels, immune checkpoint 
genes, mutations, and functional enrichment analysis. The distribution of APOE 
in immune cell populations was also determined using a single-cell database.
RESULTS: APOE mRNA was significantly overexpressed in HCC at both 
transcriptional and translational levels. Survival analysis suggested that APOE 
might be a favorable prognostic indicator for HCC patients. In addition to its 
involvement in immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint gene expression, 
genetic variation, immunomodulatory genes, and methylation alterations in HCC, 
enrichment analysis showed that APOE was involved in multiple cancer-related 
signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively examines the critical role of APOE in HCC 
and highlights its significant potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. 
This finding not only paves the way for new avenues of research in HCC, but also 
provides valuable insights into clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Protective effects of harpagoside on mitochondrial functions in rotenone‑induced 
cell models of Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 
after Alzheimer's disease. Currently, no radical treatment is available for this 
disease. Harpagoside is a proposed neuroprotective iridoid active ingredient 
that can be derived from Scrophulariae buergeriana, Scrophularia striata and 
Harpagophytum procumbens. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of 
harpagoside on mitochondrial functions in rotenone-induced cell models of 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuro-2A (N2A) cells were treated with rotenone to 
establish in vitro cell models of PD. Cell viability and survival were measured 
using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Biochemical assays with spectrophotometry 
were used to measure complex I activity, mitochondrial swelling and caspase 3 
activity. The cell survival rate was first found to be significantly decreased 
by rotenone (20 nmol/l) treatment. However, intervention with harpagoside (10 
µmol/l) was found to increase the cell survival rate of rotenone-induced N2A 
cell models differentiated with 1 mmol/l of dibutyryl-cAMP. At ≥0.1 µmol/l 
concentration, harpagoside significantly alleviated rotenone-induced 
mitochondrial swelling, whereas at 1 µmol/l it significantly counteracted the 
inhibitory effects of rotenone on complex I activity. At 10 µmol/l harpagoside 
significantly inhibited rotenone-induced caspase 3 activation. These results 
suggest that harpagoside has the potential to protect mitochondrial functions 
against rotenone-induced injury in N2A cell models of PD.

By using hyperpolarized 13C labeling technology, the magnetic resonance signals 
of 13C-labeled metabolic substrates are enhanced, which enables the in vivo 
monitoring of their metabolic states through magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 
Compared with traditional non-invasive metabolic diagnostic technologies, 
hyperpolarized 13C technology exhibits a number of strengths, including 
real-time monitoring, high precision, non-invasiveness, the absence of 
radiation, and the ability to assess a broader range of metabolic pathways, 
showing great potential for application in the treatment of glioma, stroke, 
Alzheimer disease, and cerebral injury. Following the approval of 
[1-13C]-pyruvate for clinical trials by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
there has been growing academic interest in this technology. Currently, the 
primary challenge lies in creating more probes and promoting their clinical 
applications. Herein, we outlined the principles of hyperpolarized 13C labeling 
technology, examined its current role in neurological metabolic diagnostics, and 
explored the future directions, including conducting hyperpolarized 13C magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology at higher magnetic field strengths (such 
as 7T), designing additional magnetic resonance sequences specific to 
hyperpolarized 13C MRS, and its integration with other neuro-metabolic 
diagnostic methods.

超极化13C标记技术通过超极化处理13C标记的代谢底物，并利用磁共振波谱监测其在体内的代谢情况。相比传统无创代谢诊断技术，超极化13C技术具备实时、精准、无创、无辐射及覆盖更广代谢链的优势，在神经胶质瘤、 
脑卒中 
、阿尔茨海默病以及脑损伤中都有着巨大的应用潜力。随着[1-13C]-丙酮酸受到美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）批准进入临床试验，该技术的学术关注度持续增加。目前，开发更多的探针并推进其临床应用是该领域面临的主要挑战。本文简述超极化13C标记技术的原理，并探讨其在神经系统代谢诊断中的现状以及未来发展方向，包括在更高磁场强度（如7T）下进行超极化13C 
磁共振波谱（magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MRS）技术、设计更多的针对超极化13C 
MRS技术的磁共振序列及与其他神经代谢诊断方法的结合。

observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), represent one of the main adverse 
events associated with treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) with anti-amyloid-β 
(anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases, patients' lives may be 
threatened. As the first anti-Aβ antibody was approved for use in China, 
clinical departments are now confronted with an increased likelihood of 
encountering ARIA in real-world scenarios. Accurate pre-treatment risk 
assessment, timely identification during medication, and severity evaluation of 
ARIA are of great significance in guiding clinical decisions. The identification 
and assessment of ARIA can be conducted from two perspectives-imaging and 
clinical symptoms. This article focuses on imaging. We reviewed the 
pathophysiological mechanisms, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and 
imaging protocols and assessment of ARIA. We also stated at the end of the 
review that most current research data on ARIA came from clinical drug trials 
involving Caucasian populations, and that there was a lack of treatment 
experience in the real-world application of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in 
Chinese populations. Many issues concerning pre-treatment risk assessment still 
need to be explored. Additionally, whether there are other clinical factors and 
imaging indicators that can help predict drug risks, and whether using different 
imaging protocols can help make a difference in patient management in the real 
world all require further investigation.

淀粉样蛋白相关影像学异常（amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, ARIA）为磁共振成像（magnetic 
resonance imaging, MRI）观察到的颅内信号异常，是阿尔茨海默病（Alzheimer's disease, 
AD）抗β淀粉样蛋白（amyloid-β, 
Aβ）单克隆抗体治疗的主要不良事件之一，严重者可危及患者生命。随着首个抗Aβ单克隆抗体在中国获批使用，临床科室在真实世界中面对ARIA的可能性将增加。ARIA在用药前的风险评估、用药期间的及时识别与严重程度判断对临床决策具有重要意义。对ARIA的识别评估可以从影像和临床症状两方面进行，本文聚焦于前者，对ARIA的病理生理学机制、流行病学及临床特点、影像检查方案及影像评估进行综述。本文最后指出，目前ARIA相关研究数据多来自高加索人种的药物临床试验，缺乏中国人真实世界应用抗Aβ单克隆抗体的治疗经验，未来的用药前风险评估仍有许多尚待探讨的问题。此外，是否存在其他帮助预判药物风险的临床因素和影像指标，使用不同的成像条件是否给真实世界的患者管理带来差异，都需要进一步探索。

Chronic occupational exposure to metals in welding fumes has been implicated in 
the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Parkinson's disease 
(PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression have 
been associated with various neurodegenerative conditions. Circulating miRNAs, 
in particular, have emerged as promising, minimally invasive biomarkers for 
diagnosing and monitoring disease progression. This study was designed to 
characterize the expression of miRNAs in neuronally-enriched serum extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) among welders and non-welders to explore their potential link to 
metal concentrations and welding exposure measures and their potential as early 
diagnostic biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Serum samples from 39 welders and 
27 healthy individuals were collected, and EV-enclosed miRNAs were extracted and 
analyzed. Also, whole blood metal concentrations and welding exposure 
measurements were obtained. Fifty miRNAs were found to be dysregulated in 
welders vs. non-welders, of which three (miR-16-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-486-5p) 
showing reduced expression and two (miR-4281 and miR-4417) exhibiting positive 
correlations with blood metal concentrations as well as with long- and 
short-term welding exposure measures. The dysregulation of these miRNAs suggests 
that exposure to metals could disrupt important biological processes, possibly 
contributing to an elevated risk of NDDs. These findings highlight the need for 
further research to validate the causal relationship between exposure to metals 
in welding fumes, the dysregulation of circulating miRNAs, and their role in 
neurodegenerative disease development, with implications for miRNA-based 
biomarkers in early disease detection and prevention.

INTRODUCTION: Little is known about how Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma 
biomarkers relate to cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) neuroimaging 
biomarkers.
METHODS: The study involved 251 Wake Forest Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA) Exam 6 participants with plasma AD biomarkers, MRI, 
amyloid PET, and adjudicated cognitive status. Multivariable models examined 
cross-sectional relationships between plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers, 
considering comorbidities.
RESULTS: Lower Aβ42/Aβ40, and higher GFAP, NfL, and p-tau217 were associated 
with greater neurodegeneration. Lower plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and higher p-tau217 and 
p-tau231 were associated with greater Aβ PET deposition. NfL was positively 
associated with WMH and WM Free Water. P-tau measures were positively associated 
with WM Free Water. Lower Aβ42/Aβ40 was associated with presence of microbleeds. 
GFAP was positively associated with WMH.
DISCUSSION: We observed expected associations of plasma biomarkers with 
cognitive status and imaging biomarkers. GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, p-tau217, and 
p-tau231 are associated with cSVD in addition to AD-related pathology.

Understanding the complex interplay between gene expression and neuronal 
activity is crucial for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive 
function and neurological disorders. Here, we developed pooled screens for 
neuronal activity, using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and the fluorescent 
calcium integrator CaMPARI2. Using this screening method, we evaluated 1343 
genes for their effect on excitability in human iPSC-derived neurons, revealing 
potential links to neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. These 
genes include known regulators of neuronal excitability, such as TARPs and ion 
channels, as well as genes associated with autism spectrum disorder and 
Alzheimer's disease not previously described to affect neuronal excitability. 
This CRISPRi-based screening platform offers a versatile tool to uncover 
molecular mechanisms controlling neuronal activity in health and disease.

Update in
    Hippocampus. 2025 Sep;35(5):e70027. doi: 10.1002/hipo.70027.

BACKGROUND: The anterior portion of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is one of the 
first regions targeted by pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE) indicating a 
potential for metrics from this region to serve as imaging biomarkers. 
Leveraging a unique post-mortem dataset of histology and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans we aimed to 1) develop an anatomically valid segmentation 
protocol for anterior entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann Area (BA) 35, and BA36 
for in vivo 3 tesla (T) MRI and 2) incorporate this protocol in an automated 
approach.
METHODS: We included 20 cases (61-97 years old, 50% females) with and without 
neurodegenerative diseases (11 vs. 9 cases) to ensure generalizability of the 
developed protocol. Digitized MTL Nissl-stained coronal histology sections from 
these cases were annotated and registered to same-subject post-mortem MRI. The 
protocol was developed by determining the location of histological borders of 
the MTL cortices in relation to anatomical landmarks. Subsequently the protocol 
was applied to 15 cases twice, with a 2-week interval, to assess intra-rater 
reliability with the Dice Similarity Index (DSI). Thereafter it was implemented 
in our in-house Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS)-T1 
approach and evaluated with DSIs.
RESULTS: The anterior histological border distances of ERC, BA35 and BA36 were 
evaluated with respect to various anatomical landmarks and the distance relative 
to the beginning of the hippocampus was chosen. To formulate segmentation rules, 
we examined the histological sections for the location of borders in 
relationship to anatomical landmarks in the coronal sections. The DSI for the 
anterior MTL cortices for the intra-rater reliability was 0.85-0.88 and for the 
ASHS-T1 against the manual segmentation was 0.62-0.65.
DISCUSSION: We developed a reliable segmentation protocol and incorporated it in 
an automated approach. Given the vulnerability of the anterior MTL cortices to 
tau deposition in AD and LATE, the updated approach is expected to improve 
imaging biomarkers for these diseases.

Mendelian randomization (MR) assesses the total effect of exposure on outcome. 
With the rapidly increasing availability of summary statistics from genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs), MR leverages existing summary statistics and is 
widely used to study the causal effects among complex traits and diseases. The 
total effect in the population is a sum of indirect and direct effects. For 
complex disease outcomes with complicated etiologies, and/or for modifiable 
exposure traits, there may exist more than one pathway between exposure and 
outcome. The direct effect and the indirect effect via a mediator of interest 
could be of opposite directions, and the total effect estimates may not be 
informative for treatment and prevention decision-making or may be even 
misleading for different subgroups of patients. Causal mediation analysis 
delineates the indirect effect of exposure on outcome operating through the 
mediator and the direct effect transmitted through other mechanisms. However, 
causal mediation analysis often requires individual-level data measured on 
exposure, outcome, mediator and confounding variables, and the power of the 
mediation analysis is restricted by sample size. In this work, motivated by a 
study of the effects of atrial fibrillation (AF) on Alzheimer's dementia, we 
propose a framework for Integrative Mendelian randomization and Mediation 
Analysis (IMMA). The proposed method integrates the total effect estimates from 
MR analyses based on large-scale GWASs with the direct and indirect effect 
estimates from mediation analysis based on individual-level data of a limited 
sample size. We introduce a series of IMMA models, under the scenarios with or 
without exposure-mediator interaction and/or study heterogeneity. The proposed 
IMMA models improve the estimation and the power of inference on the direct and 
indirect effects in the population, as well as the characterization of the 
variation of effects. Our analyses showed a significant positive direct effect 
of AF on Alzheimer's dementia risk not through the use of the oral anticoagulant 
treatment and a significant indirect effect of AF-induced anticoagulant 
treatment in reducing Alzheimer's dementia risk. The results suggested potential 
Alzheimer's dementia risk prediction and prevention strategies for AF patients, 
and paved the way for future re-evaluation of anticoagulant treatment guidelines 
for AF patients. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the sensitivity 
of the conclusions to a key assumption of the IMMA approach.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related irreversible neurodegenerative 
disease affecting mostly the elderly population. The main pathological features 
of AD are the extracellular Aβ plaques generated by APP cleavage through the 
amyloidogenic pathway, the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) resulting 
from the hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and cholinergic neurodegeneration. 
However, the actual causes of AD are unknown, but several studies suggest 
hereditary mutations in PSEN1 and -2, APOE4, APP, and the TAU genes are the 
major perpetrators. In order to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of AD, 
various hypotheses are proposed. These include the following hypotheses: amyloid 
accumulation, tauopathy, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, glutamate/excitotoxicity, cholinergic deficiency, and gut 
dysbiosis. Currently approved therapeutic interventions are donepezil, 
galantamine, and rivastigmine, which are cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), and 
memantine, which is an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. These treatment 
strategies focus on only symptomatic management of AD by attenuating symptoms 
but not regeneration of neurons or clearance of Aβ plaques and 
hyperphosphorylated Tau. This review focuses on the pathophysiology, novel 
therapeutic targets, and disease-altering treatments such as α-secretase 
modulators, active immunotherapy, passive immunotherapy, natural antioxidant 
products, nanomaterials, antiamyloid therapy, tau aggregation inhibitors, 
transplantation of fecal microbiota or stem cells, and microtubule stabilizers 
that are in clinical trials or still under investigation.

Under normal physiological conditions, gut microbiota and host mutually coexist. 
They play key roles in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, absorption, and 
metabolism, as well as promoting the development of the central nervous system 
(CNS) and emotional regulation. The dysregulation of gut microbiota homeostasis 
has attracted significant research interest, specifically in its impact on 
neurological and psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the 
important role of the gut- brain axis in conditions including Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and depression. This review aims to 
elucidate the regulatory mechanisms by which gut microbiota affect the 
progression of CNS disorders via the gut-brain axis. Additionally, we discuss 
the current research landscape, identify gaps, and propose future directions for 
microbial interventions against these diseases. Finally, we provide a 
theoretical reference for clinical treatment strategies and drug development for 
AD, PD, and depression.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (1-40) 
(Αβ1-40), an emerging biomarker of cardiovascular disease, may be involved in 
the heart-brain-renal axis. We aimed to comprehensively explore the association 
between circulating Aβ1-40 levels and renal function and its clinical relevance.
METHODS: Consecutively recruited subjects in the Athens Angiometabolic Registry 
with measured Aβ1-40 plasma levels (n = 811) were analysed. Αβ1-40 was measured 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 
calculated using the abbreviated four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal 
Disease (MDRD) formula. All-cause mortality was the main clinical endpoint 
across a median follow-up of 47 months.
RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, a bidirectional association between Αβ1-40 [adjusted 
odds ratio (adjOR) = 3.67 for highest tertile of Αβ1-40 and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stage ≥3, p < .001] and CKD stage ≥3 (adjOR = 3.52 for association 
with highest Aβ1-40 tertile, p < .001) was observed. Longitudinally, increased 
Αβ1-40 at baseline was associated with decline in renal function at follow-up 
(adjOR for CKD stage ≥3 = 2.26, p = .033). Similarly, longitudinal changes in 
Aβ1-40 were inversely associated with changes in GFR (OR = .77 per 1 SD increase 
in Aβ1-40, p = .006). Aβ1-40 was associated with all-cause mortality, 
independently of traditional risk factors (hazard ratio = 1.20 per 1 SD increase 
in Aβ1-40, p = .016). An indirect effect of GFR on the association between 
Aβ1-40 and mortality (p < .05) with an estimated indirect-to-total effect ratio 
of .334, but not of Αβ1-40 on GFR with mortality, was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a wide range of GFR, we found a bidirectional 
association between Αβ1-40 levels and renal function. The association of Αβ1-40 
with all-cause mortality was partly mediated by lower GFR.

Many neurodegenerative diseases are directly related to the formation of toxic 
protein aggregates, such as Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with the 
aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ). In this context, protein fibrils are the 
hallmark of these neurodegenerative diseases. In this sense, developing 
compounds capable of preventing or reducing the formation of protein aggregation 
in the brain can be of fundamental importance for the curative treatment of 
these diseases. Animals' venom compounds are known to be selected for nervous 
system targets, therefore, they are considered an interesting platform for 
developing pharmacological tools. This work presents a study of the ligands 
Octovespin (bioinspired by the wasp venom Polybia occidentalis) and 
Fraternine-10 (bioinspired by the wasp venom Parachartergus fraternus) 
concerning the disaggregation and anti-aggregation of fibrils of Aβ(17-42) 
sheets. First, we performed in silico calculations using molecular docking and 
molecular dynamics simulations with 200 ns. The results indicate that Octovespin 
and Fraternine-10 interact with the Aβ protein fibrils throughout all simulation 
time. The RMSD, RMSF, number of hydrogen and radius of gyration values and the 
interactions with amino acids responsible for fibril aggregation demonstrate 
that both Octovespin and Fraternine-10 have a significant disaggregation 
potential, which corroborates the in vitro and in vivo experimental 
observations. Furthermore, experimental data of Fraternine-10 demonstrated an 
anti-aggregation effect, indicating that it can promote fibril disaggregation 
and prevent them from aggregating again to form oligomers. However, in vivo data 
of Fraternine-10 did not show improvement. Even though in vivo results were not 
promising, the in vitro and in silico discoveries qualify these molecules as 
potential sources for developing new candidates to become medicines against 
Alzheimer's disease.

Oxidative stress is the crucial pathologic factor for causing neuron death and 
cognitive impairment in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a 
special antioxidant, molecular hydrogen (H2) is responsible for alleviating 
oxidative stress and associated inflammatory symptoms. However, in vivo 
continuous and efficient hydrogen accumulation is rather difficult to realize, 
thus frequent dosing is required to ensure the desired therapeutic effect. 
Herein, hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composites are rationally 
designed to achieve sustainable near-infrared II (NIR-II) photocatalytic 
hydrogen evolution reaction for relieving neuroinflammation in AD model mice. 
The HOFs composites mainly consist of three parts: building block porphyrin as 
the photocatalyst, DSM (NIR-II-absorbing pyridinium hemicyanine dye) as 
fluorescent emitter, and platinum nanoparticles as co-catalyst. Under NIR-II 
laser illumination, DSM acts as an energy transducer to activate porphyrin to 
produce reductive hydrogen in situ. Specially, porphyrin selectively binds with 
the accumulated Cu ions in Aβ plaques and boosts H2 evolution. KLVFFAED (KD8) is 
covalently grafted on the HOFs to improve the blood-brain barrier permeability 
in vivo. This designed system exhibits an admirable therapeutic effect for 
relieving inflammation and recovering cognitive disorder in AD model mice, thus 
providing a new way for exploring HOFs used for sustainable hydrogen therapy.

Endothelial cells (ECs) are a highly specialized and heterogeneous population 
that plays a fundamental role in maintaining vascular homeostasis, immune 
regulation, and blood flow control. Beyond serving as a physical barrier, ECs 
exhibit remarkable plasticity, undergoing phenotypic transitions, including 
endothelial-to-mesenchymal (EndMT), endothelial-to-hematopoietic (EndHT), 
endothelial-to-osteoblast (EndOT) and endothelial-to-immune-cell-like (EndICLT). 
These transitions allow ECs to adapt to developmental, physiological, and 
pathological conditions. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and 
associated technologies have provided deeper insights into the molecular 
diversity of ECs across different vascular beds and stages of development, 
revealing their transcriptional heterogeneity and specialized functions. For 
example, ECs within the aortic arch display distinct phenotypic variations 
depending on their location, reflecting adaptations to regional differences in 
blood flow and shear stress. Activated EndMT has been implicated in the 
progression of various cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, 
atherosclerosis, and vascular malformations by contributing to endothelial 
dysfunction, vascular wall inflammation, and remodeling. Recent therapeutic 
approaches aim to mitigate EndMT-associated vascular damage through 
interventions such as endothelial reprogramming, statins, and autophagy 
enhancers. Partial reprogramming of ECs has shown promise in restoring 
endothelial function, reducing vascular stiffness, and lowering blood pressure 
in hypertensive models. Understanding the complexity of EC heterogeneity and 
plasticity is critical for developing targeted therapies to prevent and treat 
cardiovascular diseases. By leveraging emerging genomic technologies and 
reprogramming strategies, future research may offer novel regenerative medicine 
approaches to restore vascular health and improve clinical outcomes for patients 
with cardiovascular diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on the utility of plasma biomarkers to predict 
incident abnormal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). In this study we 
evaluate the association of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers with 
amyloid PET progression among initially amyloid PET negative (A-) individuals.
METHODS: We included 290 A-, cognitively unimpaired Mayo Clinic Study of Aging 
participants. We estimated the association of each baseline plasma biomarker 
with progression from A- to A+ and with rate of amyloid PET change.
RESULTS: Interquartile range differences in amyloid beta 42/40, percent 
phosphorylated tau 217 (%p-tau217), and Amyloid Probability Score 2 were 
associated with 1.29 (P = 0.09), 1.38 (P < 0.001), and 1.20 (P = 0.05) 
increases, respectively, in the hazard of progression from A- to A+ and 0.27 
(P = 0.16), 0.50 (P = 0.007), and 0.28 (P = 0.15) Centiloid/year increases, 
respectively, in annual rate of amyloid PET change.
DISCUSSION: Plasma %p-tau217 may be a useful screening tool to enrich for 
participants with increased likelihood of progressing from normal to abnormal 
amyloid PET in a primary prevention trial.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 was associated with amyloid positron 
emission tomography progression, negative to positive. The associations were 
weaker for amyloid beta 42/40 and Amyloid Probability Score 2. Age and 
apolipoprotein E ε4 carriership were also important predictors. These markers 
may be useful for enrichment of a primary prevention trial.

INTRODUCTION: Physical activity is associated with greater myelin content in 
older individuals with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), a condition marked 
by demyelination. However, potential mechanisms underlying this relationship 
remain understudied.
METHODS: We assessed cross-sectionally whether serum high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL), low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides moderated the association 
between physical activity and in vivo myelin in older individuals with CSVD and 
mild cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: We included 81 highly educated, community-dwelling older individuals 
(mean age 74.57 years), 64% of whom were female. Regression models revealed that 
HDL levels significantly moderated the relationship between physical activity 
and myelin in the sagittal stratum, wherein higher physical activity levels were 
linked to greater myelin levels for those with average or high HDL (standardized 
B [95% CI] = 0.289 [0.087 to 0.491], p = 0.006).
DISCUSSION: Physical activity may promote myelin health partly through HDL. Data 
from longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings.
HIGHLIGHTS: Myelin loss is common in individuals with cerebral small vessel 
disease (CSVD). Physical activity was positively associated with myelin in older 
adults with CSVD. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) levels were also positively 
related to myelin. Physical activity effects on myelin were moderated by HDL 
levels.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that 
affects the elder population and is linked to behavioral instability and 
cognitive decline. Only a few drugs are approved for clinical management of AD. 
Volatile oils and their components exhibit diverse pharmacological potentials, 
including neuroprotective properties. The current study aimed to evaluate 
isoeugenol's neuroprotective potentials against cognitive impairments caused by 
scopolamine.
METHODS: Standard protocols were followed in the In-vitro antioxidant, 
cholinesterase inhibitory and molecular docking assays. Isoeugenol was initially 
evaluated for antioxidant potential using DPPH and ABTS free radicals scavenging 
assays. Subsequently, AChE/BChE inhibition studies were performed following 
Ellman's assay. To assess the compound's binding effectiveness at the enzymes' 
target site, it was docked against the binding sites of cholinesterase. The 
effect of isoeugenol supplementation on scopolamine-induced amnesia was assessed 
using Shallow Water Maze (SWM), Y-Maze and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) tests.
RESULTS: In DPPH and ABTS assays, isoeugenol exhibited considerable efficacy 
against free radicals with IC50 of 38.97 and 43.76 μg/mL, respectively. 
Isoeugenol revealed 78.39 ± 0.40% and 67.73 ± 0.03% inhibitions against AChE and 
BChE, respectively, at 1 mg/ml concentration. In docking studies, isoeugenol 
exhibited a docking score of -12.2390, forming two hydrogen bonds at the active 
site residues of AChE. Further, with a docking score of -10.1632, isoeugenol 
binds adequately to the BChE enzyme via two arene-hydrogen interactions and one 
hydrogen bond.
CONCLUSION: Isoeugenol offered considerable protection against 
scopolamine-induced memory deficits and improved the special memory of the 
rodents.

INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies have shown that 
amyloid beta (Aβ) is significantly correlated with glucose metabolism in mild 
cognitive impairment independently of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype.
METHODS: We used a singular value decomposition (SVD) approach to pairwise 
cross-correlation among tau, Aβ, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET images. The 
resulting SVD-based tau and Aβ scores as well as the APOE ε4 genotype, were 
entered as predictors in a voxelwise general linear model for statistical 
assessment of their effect on FDG.
RESULTS: We found cortical regions where a reduced glucose metabolism was 
maximally correlated with distributed patterns of tau, accounting for the effect 
of Aβ and APOE ε4 genotype.
DISCUSSION: By highlighting the more significant role of tau, rather than Aβ, in 
the reduction of glucose metabolism, our results provide a better understanding 
of their combined effect in the development and progression of Alzheimer's 
disease.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study uses a data-driven singular value decomposition approach 
to the cross-correlation matrix between tau and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images, 
as well as between FDG and amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) 
images. From a population of mild cognitive impairment subjects, we found that 
spatially distributed scores of tau PET are associated with an even stronger 
reduction of glucose metabolism, independent of the apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype 
and confounded by Aβ. By highlighting the more significant role of tau, rather 
than Aβ, on the reduction of glucose metabolism, our results provide a better 
understanding of their combined effects in the development of Alzheimer's 
disease.

INTRODUCTION: The long-term implications of disclosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired individuals are unknown.
METHODS: We compared participants who disclosed their elevated amyloid imaging 
result in a preclinical AD trial to those who disclosed a not elevated result 
and enrolled in an observational cohort that underwent parallel assessments. Our 
primary outcome was a score > 0 on the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating 
Scale (CSSRS) at any visit; we also considered suicidal behaviors (CSSRS > 5).
RESULTS: Among 1707 total participants (68% elevated amyloid, mean [standard 
deviation] age 71.5 [4.7], 60% female, 90% non-Hispanic White), followed for a 
mean 218 (74.1) weeks, there were no suicides and few indications of suicidal 
thoughts (n = 124 [7%]) or behaviors (n = 13 [<1%]). In a generalized estimating 
equation model controlling for covariates, we observed no effect of amyloid 
status on the primary outcome of CSSRS > 0 (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence 
interval = 0.76, 3.37).
DISCUSSION: With a structured approach, brain amyloid results can be returned 
safely.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study was 
among the first and largest studies to include biomarker disclosure in a 
population without cognitive impairment. Routine psychological assessment 
provided a novel assessment of the impact of disclosure in this sample. Learning 
an elevated brain amyloid result through a protocolized approach was not 
associated with suicidal thoughts or behaviors compared to a matched cohort who 
learned they did not have elevated brain amyloid. Future research will be needed 
to ensure similar safety in more real-world settings.

INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele status is associated with an 
increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and should be determined prior to 
initiation of anti-amyloid beta antibody treatment, because of increased risk of 
treatment-related side effects. Plasma-based apoE4 proteotyping may be an 
alternative to genotyping, with limited clinical evidence.
METHODS: apoE4 proteotyping was performed on 164 memory-clinic patients, using 
one chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and one nucleic acid-linked 
immunosandwich assay (NULISA). The assays were evaluated against APOE ε4 blood 
genotyping.
RESULTS: The CLEIA had a 100% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify APOE 
ε4 homozygosity and carriership in relation to genotyping. The NULISA had a 
92.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity to classify homozygosity and a 100% 
sensitivity and 98.5% specificity to classify carriership.
DISCUSSION: The high performance suggests that the assays may be used as an 
easily available tool for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 
genotyping in a two-step approach.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma-based proteotyping presented good to excellent sensitivity in 
identifying apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 homozygosity. The negative predictive 
value was also very good to excellent, allowing us to rule out APOE ε4 
homozygosity with high precision. Assays with excellent precision show potential 
for identifying individuals for definitive APOE ε4 genotyping in a two-step 
approach.

Hericium erinaceus: A possible future therapeutic treatment for the prevention 
and delayed progression of Alzheimer's disease? - A narrative review.

At present, the treatment of Alzheimer's disease involves only symptomatic 
medications which have continually demonstrated little efficacy, primarily due 
to the presence of biological barriers. Despite efforts, researchers have yet to 
discover a therapeutic treatment that delays neurodegenerative progression or 
restores associated Alzheimer neuropathological processes. For centuries, 
Hericium erinaceus (HE) has been used predominantly in Asian countries for its 
culinary and medicinal purposes; however, this mushroom has not yet been 
utilised in western pharmacology. This review systematically investigates 
evidence pertaining to the use of HE as a potential future therapeutic treatment 
for the prevention and delayed progression of Alzheimer's disease, by 
highlighting any fundamental neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. In 
total, three human clinical trials and thirteen animal-model studies were 
included in review. The use of HE demonstrated positive significant differences 
in results obtained from behavioural, histological and biochemical assessments 
from both human clinical trials and animal model studies accentuating its 
utility for the improvement of cognitive function. In addition, 
erinacine-A-enriched HE appears to demonstrate the highest bioactive potency of 
all HE extracted compounds, providing the greatest effects while also showing 
transportability ease across biological barriers. In conclusion, evidence 
suggests that intake of HE may be an appropriate and relevant future therapeutic 
treatment for the prevention and delayed progression of Alzheimer's disease; 
however, continued research is necessary to provide further significant evidence 
of this relationship, through an increased quantity of human clinical trials.

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a network system that connects devices 
with medical and healthcare for the ultimate aim of collecting, transmitting, 
and analyzing the acquired data in the presence of the internet. A wide range of 
equipment and monitoring systems have been generated with IoMT, and they permit 
real-time monitoring, sharing the data, analysis, patient care, and for 
efficient operation. At the advanced level, it is highly facilitated with remote 
patient digital monitoring and telemedicine. IoMT has a significant potential to 
enhance the care of Alzheimer's disease patients to overcome issues with a 
progressive neurological condition, memory loss, cognition, and behavior. This 
study aims to bring the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) to be 
implemented in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), with a special focus on 
Alzheimer's disease patients.

Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) is one of the most important 
age-dependent degenerative heart valve disorders in both humans and dogs. It is 
characterized by the aberrant remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM), 
regulated by senescent myofibroblasts (aVICs) transitioning from quiescent valve 
interstitial cells (qVICs), primarily under TGFB1/TGF-β1 control. In the present 
study, we found senescent aVICs exhibited impaired macroautophagy/autophagy as 
evidenced by compromised autophagy flux and immature autophagosomes. 
MTOR-dependent autophagy induced by rapamycin and torin-1 attenuated cell 
senescence and decreased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 
(CDKIs) CDKN2A/p16INK4A and CDKN1A/p21CIP1. Furthermore, induction of autophagy 
in aVICs by ATG (autophagy related) gene overexpression restored autophagy flux, 
with a concomitant reduction in CDKN1A and CDKN2A expression and 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Conversely, autophagy 
deficiency induced CDKN1A and CDKN2A accumulation and SASP, whereas ATG 
re-expression alleviated senescent phenotypic transformation. Notably, CDKN1A 
and CDKN2A localized to autophagosomes and lysosomes following MTOR antagonism 
or MG132 treatment. SQSTM1/p62 was identified as the autophagy receptor to 
selectively sequester CDKN1A and CDKN2A cargoes for autophagic degradation. Our 
findings are the first demonstration that CDKN1A and CDKN2A are degraded through 
SQSTM1-mediated selective autophagy, independent of the ubiquitin-proteasome 
pathway. These data will inform development of therapeutic strategies for the 
treatment of canine and human MMVD, and for the treatment of Alzheimer disease, 
Parkinson disease and other age-related degenerative disorders.Abbreviations:

INTRODUCTION: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) manifests as 
dementia combined with other neurological symptoms. However, small fiber 
neuropathy (SFN) and pathology remain unknown in NIID.
METHODS: A total of 294 subjects, including patients with NIID, Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and healthy 
controls (HCs), were included. Clinical scales, sensory and autonomic function 
testing, and skin biopsy were performed.
RESULTS: NIID patients had more severe sensory and autonomic dysfunction than 
other groups. Substantial reductions in intraepidermal, sweat gland, and 
pilomotor nerve fiber densities were observed in NIID patients, with a 
non-length dependent pattern. Detailed analysis revealed marked reductions in 
noradrenergic, cholinergic, peptidergic, and regenerative nerve fibers. Small 
fiber densities showed high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing NIID from HCs 
and other diseases.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to reveal wide and severe loss of small 
fibers in NIID, suggesting the involvement of SFN in the pathogenesis of NIID.
HIGHLIGHTS: Our study is the first to identify wide and severe non-length 
dependent small fiber neuropathy in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease 
(NIID) patients. Approximately 50% of NIID patients exhibited pure small fiber 
neuropathy without large fiber or mixed neuropathy. NIID patients showed a 
significant reduction in noradrenergic, cholinergic, peptidergic, and 
regenerative fiber innervation. Small fiber densities, especially intraepidermal 
nerve fiber density, demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing 
NIID patients from healthy controls and other disease groups. Findings suggest 
that small fiber neuropathy may play a role in the pathogenesis of NIID.

Loss of synaptic activity correlates best with cognitive dysfunction in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that mild inhibition of 
mitochondrial complex I with the small molecule tricyclic pyrone compound CP2 
restores long-term potentiation and cognitive function assessed by 
electrophysiology and behavior tests in multiple mouse models of AD. Using 
serial block-face scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional electron 
microscopy reconstruction, we examined the effect of CP2 treatment on synapses, 
and the distribution and morphology of synaptic mitochondria in the hippocampus 
of APP/PS1 mice. Structural data confirmed the loss of synapses in APP/PS1 
compared to non-transgenic (NTG) littermates. Mitochondrial distribution 
assessed in pre- and postsynaptic compartments was significantly altered in AD 
model demonstrating increased presence of mitochondria around dendritic spines 
compared to NTG mice, indicating the loss of mitochondrial ability to support 
synaptic function. CP2 treatment restored distribution of synaptic mitochondria 
and the number of synapses to the NTG control levels. Improved synaptic function 
in CP2-treated APP/PS1 mice was supported by RNA-seq analysis indicating 
upregulation of genes involved in axonal guidance, dendritic maturation and 
synaptic function, and Western blot analysis of brain tissue. Taken together, 
functional, imaging, biochemistry and structural findings further support the 
potential of targeting mitochondria as a therapeutic approach for AD.

INTRODUCTION: Foundational models suggest Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be 
diagnosed using retinal images, but the specific structural features remain 
poorly understood. This study investigates retinal vascular changes in 
individuals with cognitive impairment in three East Asian regions.
METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Ningxia, 
collecting retinal images from 176 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
or AD and 264 controls. The VC-Net deep learning model segmented arterial/venous 
networks, extracting 36 vascular features.
RESULTS: Significant reductions in vessel length, segment number, and vascular 
density were observed in cognitively impaired patients, while venous structure 
and complexity were correlated with the level of cognitive function.
DISCUSSION: Retinal vascular changes may serve as indicators of cognitive 
impairment, requiring validation in larger cohorts and exploration of the 
underlying mechanisms.
HIGHLIGHTS: A deep learning segmentation model extracted diverse retinal 
vascular features. Significant alterations in the structure of retinal 
arterial/venous networks were identified. Partitioning vessel-rich retinal zones 
improved detection of vascular changes. Decreases in vessel length, segment 
number, and vascular density were found in CI individuals.

INTRODUCTION: Factors influencing plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers 
remain incompletely understood. Here we evaluated Fujirebio plasma p-Tau217 in 
two diverse cohorts among whom 91% underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.
METHODS: Non-Hispanic White (NHW, n = 113), Black/African American (B/AA, 
n = 66), and Chinese American (ChA, n = 38) participants recruited from two 
universities were included. We examined if plasma p-Tau217 correlated with CSF 
and clinical factors, differed between racial groups, and associated with novel 
CSF proteins.
RESULTS: CSF p-Tau181 strongly correlated with CSF p-Tau217 (R2 = 0.912) which 
moderately correlated with plasma p-Tau217 (R2 = 0.694). Plasma p-Tau217 levels 
were higher with greater cognitive impairment but lower in B/AA than NHW 
participants even after adjusting for CSF p-Tau181. This resulted in greater 
positive predictive value for NHW than B/AA participants, and could be mediated 
by complement or lysosomal pathways.
DISCUSSION: Severity of cognitive impairment and race both influence plasma 
p-Tau217 levels beyond race-associated differences in CSF p-Tau181.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitive impairment associates with plasma p-Tau217 independent of 
CSF biomarkers. Black/African Americans had lower plasma p-Tau217 than 
non-Hispanic White Americans. CSF p-Tau181 could not explain lower plasma 
p-Tau217 in Black/African Americans. Plasma p-Tau217 difference results in more 
false positive cases according to race. Novel CSF processes were associated with 
race-related plasma p-Tau217 difference.

As intrinsic immune cells in the central nervous system, microglia play a 
crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Microglia can transition from 
homeostasis to various responsive states in reaction to different external 
stimuli, undergoing corresponding alterations in glucose metabolism. In 
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), 
microglial glucose metabolic reprogramming is widespread. This reprogramming 
leads to changes in microglial function, exacerbating neuroinflammation and the 
accumulation of pathological products, thereby driving the progression of 
neurodegeneration. This review summarizes the specific alterations in glucose 
metabolism within microglia in AD, PD, ALS, and MS, as well as the corresponding 
treatments aimed at reprogramming glucose metabolism. Compounds that inhibit key 
glycolytic enzymes like hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), or 
activate regulators of energy metabolism such as AMP-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK), have shown significant potential in the treatment of various 
neurodegenerative diseases. However, current research faces numerous challenges, 
including side effects and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of compounds. 
Screening relevant drugs from natural products, especially flavonoids, is a 
reliable approach. On the one hand, longtime herbal medical practices provide a 
certain degree of assurance regarding clinical safety, and their chemical 
properties contribute to effective BBB permeability. On the other hand, the 
concurrent anti-tumor and anti-neuroinflammatory activities of flavonoids 
suggest that regulation of glucose metabolism reprogramming might be a potential 
common mechanism of action. Notably, considering the dynamic nature of 
microglial metabolism, there is an urgent need to develop technologies for 
real-time monitoring of glucose metabolism processes, which would significantly 
advance research in this field.

The identification of microglia subtypes is important for understanding the role 
of innate immunity in neurodegenerative diseases. Current methods of 
unsupervised cell type identification assume a small noise-to-signal ratio of 
transcriptome measurements to produce well-separated cell clusters. However, 
identification of subtypes can be obscured by gene expression noise, which 
diminishes the distances in transcriptome space between distinct cell types, 
blurs boundaries, and reduces reproducibility. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) 
diffusion maps to model cellular differentiation as a stochastic process whereby 
cells settle into local minima that correspond to cell subtypes, in a potential 
landscape constructed from transcriptome data using a nearest neighbor graph 
approach. By applying critical transition fields, we identify individual cells 
on the verge of transitioning between subtypes, revealing microglial cells in an 
inactivated, homeostatic state before radially transitioning into various 
specialized subtypes. Specifically, we show that cells from Alzheimer's disease 
patients are enriched in a microglia subtype associated to antigen presentation 
and T-cell recruitment, and are depleted in an anti-inflammatory subtype.

BACKGROUND: Long-term care (LTC) residents are vulnerable to invasive infection. 
Appropriate use and training on personal protective equipment (PPE) is important 
for protecting residents and healthcare workers (HCWs). Studies on the barriers 
and facilitators to PPE use are limited in LTC settings.
AIM: To characterize HCWs' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to the 
uptake and appropriate use of PPE in LTC facilities in Calgary, Alberta.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with HCWs from April to 
October 2022. Interview transcripts were analysed deductively to identify themes 
from the Theoretical Domains Framework.
FINDINGS: Seven HCWs were interviewed. Barriers and facilitators fell within six 
overarching themes including: availability and quality of PPE; knowing how to 
use PPE; familial obligations; convenience and comfort; sense of professional 
duty; and social influences and identity. Additional factors such as 
understaffing and the need for more training sessions were highlighted. 
Strategies to improve PPE use were identified by HCWs, including the use of PPE 
champions, regular audits, and constructive feedback.
CONCLUSION: Identification of unique barriers and facilitators regarding PPE use 
by HCWs in LTC will facilitate targeted interventions to improve PPE use in this 
setting.

Aging is the leading risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Understanding the 
intricate interplay between biological aging and the AD pathophysiology may help 
to discover innovative treatments. The relationship between aging and core 
pathways of AD pathogenesis (amyloidopathy and tauopathy) have been extensively 
studied in preclinical models. However, the potential discordance between 
preclinical models and human pathology could represent a limitation in the 
identification of new therapeutic targets. This narrative review aims to gather 
the evidence currently available on the associations of β-Amyloid and Tau 
pathology with the hallmarks of aging in human studies. Briefly, our review 
suggests that while several hallmarks exhibit a robust association with AD 
pathogenesis (e.g., epigenetic alterations, chronic inflammation, dysbiosis), 
others (e.g., telomere attrition, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion) 
demonstrate either no relationship or weak associations. This is often due to 
limitations such as small sample sizes and study designs, being either 
cross-sectional or with short follow-up intervals, limiting the generalizability 
of the findings. Distinct hallmarks play varying roles in different stages of AD 
pathology, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies with longer follow-up 
periods. Considering the intricate interconnections across the hallmarks of 
aging, future research on AD pathology should focus on multiple hallmarks 
simultaneously.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias 
(AD/ADRD) are prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, posing a critical worldwide 
public health challenge. Ambient air pollution has been identified as a 
potential risk factor for AD progression based on toxicological and 
epidemiological studies. We aimed to evaluate the impacts of air 
pollution-including fine particulate matter (PM2·5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 
summer ozone (O3), and oxidant-on readmission or death among Medicare enrollees 
previously hospitalised with an AD/ADRD diagnosis code.
METHODS: We constructed a population-based nationwide retrospective cohort 
including all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (aged ≥65 years) in the 
contiguous USA (2000-16) hospitalised with AD/ADRD, and followed them up from 
the year after their first hospitalisation until (1) year of death (mortality 
cohort) and (2) year of second hospitalisation for any cause (readmission 
cohort). We calculated annual average PM2·5, NO2, summer O3, and oxidant 
concentrations for each individual at their residential ZIP code in each year 
after their first hospitalisation with AD/ADRD. We applied Cox proportional 
hazard models for the mortality and readmission cohorts stratifying on 
individual risk factors and adjusting for socioeconomic status, seasonal 
temperatures, and relative humidity.
FINDINGS: Our cohort consisted of 5 544 118 individuals, of whom 4 543 759 
(82·0%) died and 3 880 894 (70·0%) were readmitted to the hospital during the 
study period. The average follow-up times were 3·34 years (SD 2·60) for the 
mortality cohort and 1·98 years (SD 1·65) for the readmission cohort. In both 
the mortality and readmission cohorts we found significant associations with 
each pollutant. For an IQR increase in NO2, we found a hazard ratio (HR) for 
mortality of 1·012 (95% CI 1·009-1·015) and an HR for readmission of 1·110 
(1·104-1·117). In the readmission cohort, we found an HR of 1·084 (1·079-1·089) 
for an IQR increase (3·87 μg/m3) in PM2·5. The results slightly decreased in 
multi-pollutant models. The results of effect modification for mortality and 
readmission varied by pollutant, but higher risks were found among Black males 
and among those eligible for Medicaid in general.
INTERPRETATION: We provide new evidence that among a susceptible population with 
previous AD/ADRD-related hospitalisations, annual air pollution exposure since 
first hospitalisation is associated with risk of readmission and death.

GGGGCC repeat expansions in C9orf72 are a common genetic cause of amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis in people of European ancestry; however, substantial 
variability in the penetrance of the mutation, age at disease onset, and 
clinical presentation can complicate diagnosis and prognosis. The repeat 
expansion is bidirectionally transcribed in the sense and antisense directions 
into repetitive RNAs and translated into dipeptide repeat proteins, and both 
accumulate in the cortex, cerebellum, and the spinal cord. Furthermore, 
neuropathological aggregates of phosphorylated TDP-43 are observed in motor 
cortex and other cortical regions, and in the spinal cord of patients at 
autopsy. C9orf72 repeat expansions can also cause frontotemporal dementia. The 
GGGGCC repeat induces a complex interplay of loss-of-function and 
gain-of-function pathological mechanisms. Clinical trials using antisense 
oligonucleotides to target the GGGGCC repeat RNA have not been successful, 
potentially because they only target a single gain-of-function mechanism. Novel 
therapeutic approaches targeting the DNA repeat expansion, multiple 
repeat-derived RNA species, or downstream targets of TDP-43 dysfunction are, 
however, on the horizon, together with the development of diagnostic and 
prognostic biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Given the lack of satisfactory clinical treatments for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition detrimental to health, developing 
alternative therapies is critical. Tianqi Yizhi Granule (TQYZ) is a preparation 
used to treat AD based on traditional Chinese medicine theory, the latent 
mechanisms of which await elucidation.
PURPOSE: This study sought to investigate the neuroprotective properties of TQYZ 
while exploring its potential therapeutic mechanisms using network pharmacology 
analyses and experimental validation.
METHODS: Network pharmacology analyses were performed. Cognitive and 
neurodegenerative alterations were evaluated through behavioral tests and 
histological staining. For in vivo and in vitro experiments, short hairpin RNA 
sequences were transfected via adeno-associated virus vectors to verify the 
predicted mechanism.
RESULTS: A total of 159 potential therapeutic targets of TQYZ overlapped with 
AD-related targets. In senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, 
treatment with TQYZ significantly improved cognitive function, ameliorated 
neuronal damage and apoptosis, and upregulated the protein expression of PKC/ERK 
pathway members. TQYZ maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced 
the generation of reactive oxygen species, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis in 
Aβ25-35-induced HT22 cells. However, these neuroprotective effects were notably 
reduced in shRNA PRKCB-transfected HT22 cells and SAMP8 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: TQYZ mitigates the pathological degeneration process and cognitive 
impairment in SAMP8 mice and suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis 
in HT22 cells treated with Aβ25-35. Its neuroprotective mechanism is linked to 
PKC/ERK pathway activation. This study highlights a promising strategy for AD 
therapy.

Neddylation is a biological process that covalently links neuronal precursor 
cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) to its substrate. 
Its main function is to activate the cullin ubiquitin junction complex, thereby 
promoting substrate protein degradation. The research of neddylation mainly 
focus on cell senescence, Alzheimer's disease progression, and tumor treatment. 
However, the neddylation mechanism underlying follicular granulosa cells (GCs) 
proliferation and steroidogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed 
to reveal the functions of neddylation in sheep follicular GCs. Here, 
immunohistochemistry results revealed that NEDD8 was expressed in sheep 
follicular GCs. The neddylation-specific inhibitor MLN4924 and NEDD8 small 
interfering (si) RNA (si-NEDD8) were used to inhibit neddylation, significantly 
attenuating sheep follicular GC proliferation. The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) 
showed that cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) and steroidogenic acute regulator 
(StAR) were significantly downregulated via the inhibition of neddylation. 
Additionally, qRT-PCR results showed that CYP11A1, StAR and 3β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) mRNA abundance decreased significantly following the 
addition of various MLN4924 doses and si-NEDD8, however, CYP19A1 mRNA levels did 
not significantly differ. Western blotting results showed that inhibition of 
neddylation also significantly decreased the expression of CYP11A1, 3β-HSD, 
cytochrome P450 19A1 (CYP19A1), StAR, and androgen receptor (AR). The current 
study revealed that the inhibition of neddylation affects sheep follicular GC 
function by inhibiting proliferation and the enzymes involved in synthesis in 
sheep.

BACKGROUND: Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) affects young individuals and 
is typically successfully managed with anti-seizure medications (ASMs). 
Discontinuing therapy in IGE patients is a critical decision due to the risk of 
seizure recurrence. This study aims to identify factors influencing seizure 
freedom (SF) or relapse after ASM discontinuation.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients seen at our 
clinic between 2002 and 2024. Collected data included demographics, disease 
history, seizure types, ASMs used, EEG findings, outcomes related to SF and ASM 
withdrawal.
RESULTS: We identified 322 records, with a mean age of 30 ± 12.4 years and an 
age at onset of 16 ± 5.9 years. On average, patients tried 1.9 ASMs, 23% on 
polytherapy. The main seizure types were generalized tonic-clonic seizures 
(GTCS) in 53.1%, myoclonic seizures in 31.7%, absences in 15.2%. SF was achieved 
by 76.6%. Patients with GTCS as main seizure type or presenting with GTCS in 
the first year of disease experienced a delayed achievement of SF. ASM 
discontinuation was attempted in 64 patients. Predictors of relapse after 
discontinuation were myoclonic and generalized seizures as principal seizure 
type and higher seizure frequency. Early SF and lower seizure frequency were 
associated with successful discontinuation. EEG predictors of discontinuation 
failure included worsening during treatment tapering and specific abnormalities, 
such as spike waves, photosensitivity, and hyperpnoea sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides long-term follow-up data on IGE patients, 
highlighting key predictors of seizure control, including GTCS or myoclonic 
seizures and a rapid initial ASM response. EEG emerges as a valuable tool for 
the longitudinal monitoring of patients undergoing ASM discontinuation.

INTRODUCTION: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a reliable neuroimaging 
technique for assessing regional load of tau pathology in the brain, but its 
routine clinical use is limited by cost and accessibility barriers.
METHODS: We thoroughly investigated the ability of various machine learning 
models to predict clinically useful tau-PET composites (load and laterality 
index) from low-cost and non-invasive features, for example, clinical variables, 
plasma biomarkers, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: Models including plasma biomarkers yielded the most accurate 
predictions of tau-PET burden (best model: R-squared = 0.66-0.69), with 
especially high contribution from plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217). MRI 
variables were the best predictors of asymmetric tau load between the two 
hemispheres (best model: R-squared = 0.28-0.42). The models showed high 
generalizability to external test cohorts with data collected at multiple sites. 
Through a proof-of-concept two-step classification workflow, we also 
demonstrated possible model translations to a clinical setting.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the promising and limiting aspects of using 
machine learning to predict tau-PET from scalable cost-effective variables, with 
findings relevant for clinical settings and future research.
HIGHLIGHTS: Accessible variables showed potential in estimating tau tangle load 
and distribution. Plasma phosphorylated tau-217 (p-tau217) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) were the best predictors of different tau-PET (positron 
emission tomography) composites. Machine learning models demonstrated high 
generalizability across AD cohorts.

INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus (HHV) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
METHODS: We leveraged functional genomics data from Religious Orders Study or 
the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) 
brain biobanks and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from HHV-infected forebrain 
organoids to investigate HHV-infection-associated transposable element (TE) 
dysregulation underlying AD etiologies.
RESULTS: We identified widespread TE dysregulation in HHV-positive human AD 
brains, including an astrocyte-specific upregulation of LINE1 subfamily TEs in 
HHV-positive human AD brains. We further pinpointed astrocyte-specific LINE1 
upregulation that could potentially regulate target gene NEAT1 expression via 
long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. This LINE1 dysregulation 
can be partially reversed by the usage of anti-HHV drugs (valacyclovir and 
acyclovir) in a virus-infected human brain organoid model. Finally, we 
demonstrated that valacyclovir rescued tau-associated neuropathology and 
alleviated LINE1 activation in an experimental tau aggregation model.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis provides associations linking molecular, clinical, and 
neuropathological AD features with HHV infection, which warrants future clinical 
validation.
HIGHLIGHTS: Via analysis of bulk RNA-seq data in two large-scale human brain 
biobanks, ROS/MAP (n = 109 pathologically confirmed AD and n = 44 cognitively 
healthy controls) and MSBB (n = 284 AD and n = 150 cognitively healthy 
controls), we identified widespread TE activation in HHV-positive human AD 
brains and significantly positive associations of HHV RNA abundance with APOE4 
genotype, Braak staging score, and CERAD score. We identified cell type-specific 
LINE1 upregulation in both microglia and astrocytes of human AD brains via 
long-range enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions on lncRNA nuclear enriched 
abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1). We determined that usage of valacyclovir and 
acyclovir was significantly associated with reduced incidence of AD in a large 
real-world patient database. Using the HEK293 tau P301S model and U2OS mt-Keima 
cell model, we determined that valacyclovir treatment rescued tau-associated 
neuropathology and alleviated activation of LINE1 with increased cellular 
autophagy-level mechanistically supported clinical benefits of valacyclovir in 
real-world patient data.

Hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging is an important biomarker in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While hippocampal atrophy was thought to result from 
tau tangles in AD, different neuropathologies can lead to hippocampal atrophy, 
especially TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. In this narrative 
review, we evaluate existing studies on the relative contribution of tau and 
TDP-43 pathology to medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. We report a clear 
association of both tau and TDP-43 neuropathology with MTL atrophy, even after 
correcting for other neuropathologies. Next, we discuss a potential synergism 
between tau and TDP-43 and the relative timing of the effects of both 
neuropathologies. Finally, avenues for future research will be discussed. A 
better understanding of the interplay between tau and TDP-43 neuropathologies 
and their effect on atrophy will help with the development of more specific 
biomarkers for limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy and 
pinpointing of the optimal timing for testing anti-tau and anti-TDP-43 
treatments in trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Both tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 
(TDP-43) pathology contribute to medial temporal lobe atrophy. There is a 
positive association between tau and TDP-43 and potentially a synergism. It is 
unclear if tau and TDP-43 have an additive or synergistic effect on atrophy. The 
relative timing of the tau and TDP-43 effects on atrophy remains unclear. 
Clarifying the interplay between tau and TDP-43 will help improve magnetic 
resonance imaging biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Specific features of subjective cognitive decline (SCD-plus) have 
been proposed to indicate an increased risk of preclinical Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, few studies have examined how these features relate to AD 
biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults.
METHODS: Meta-analyses were performed using cross-sectional data from nine 
cohorts (n = 7219, mean age (SD): 71.17 (5.9), 56.5% female) to determine 
associations of SCD-plus features with positron emission tomography (PET)- or 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau biomarkers.
RESULTS: Participants with preclinical AD (community-based only) were more 
likely to fulfill SCD-plus features. The presence of self-reported memory 
decline, associated concern/worry, and a higher number of fulfilled features 
were all associated with high Aβ levels. Only the latter was associated with 
abnormal tau.
DISCUSSION: Simultaneous endorsement of multiple SCD-plus features is a robust 
indicator of abnormal AD biomarkers in CU older adults, whereas isolated SCD 
features seem only sensitive to elevated Aβ, supporting their value as early 
behavioral markers of preclinical AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: About two-tenths of our sample had abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels 
with evidence of subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Preclinical AD subsamples 
(community-based) had a higher percentage of participants meeting SCD-plus 
features. Self-reported memory decline and concern/worry were the sole features 
associated with high Aβ, but not tau, burden. A higher number of fulfilled 
SCD-plus features are linked to high Aβ and tau burden. Use of multiple SCD-plus 
features may help identify early stages of biological AD.

Identification of CXCR4 inhibitory activity in natural compounds using 
cheminformatics-guided machine learning algorithms.

Technological University, Shahabad Daulatpur, Bawana Road, Delhi 110042, India.

Neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by progressive damage to neurons 
that leads to cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. Current treatment 
options focus only on symptom management and palliative care, without addressing 
their root cause. In our previous study, we reported the upregulation of the CXC 
motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), in Alzheimer's disease (ad) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). We reached this conclusion by analysing gene expression patterns 
of ad and PD patients, compared to healthy individuals of similar age. We used 
RNA sequencing data from Gene Expression Omnibus to carry out this analysis. 
Herein, we aim to identify natural compounds that have potential inhibitory 
activity against CXCR4 through cheminformatics-guided machine learning, to aid 
drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders, especially ad and PD. Natural 
compounds are gaining prominence in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders 
due to their biocompatibility and potential neuroprotective properties, 
including their ability to modulate CXCR4 expression. Recent advances in 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have opened 
new avenues for drug discovery research across various therapeutic areas, 
including neurodegenerative disorders. We aim to produce an ML model using 
cheminformatics-guided machine learning algorithms using data of compounds with 
known CXCR4 activity, retrieved from the Binding Database, to analyse various 
physicochemical attributes of natural compounds obtained from the COCONUT 
Database and predict their inhibitory activity against CXCR4. Insight Box This 
work extends our previous study published in Integrative Biology (DOI: 
10.1093/intbio/zyad012). We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of AI and ML in 
identifying potential treatment options for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases. By analysing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that may 
not be apparent to human researchers, AI-powered systems can provide valuable 
insight into potential treatment options that may have been overlooked through 
traditional research methods. Our study underscores the significance of 
interdisciplinary collaboration between computational and experimental 
scientists in drug discovery and in developing a robust pipeline to identify 
potential leads for drug development.

Amyloid formation is involved in widespread health conditions such as 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type-2 diabetes. Amyloid fibrils 
have a similar cross-β architecture, but fibrils formed by a single protein 
sequence can have diverse structures, varying with time, self-assembly 
conditions, and sequence modifications. Fibril structure has been proposed to be 
diagnostic of disease, but why different structures result under different 
conditions, especially in vitro, remains elusive. We previously identified a 
small molecule, YX-I-1, which inhibits in vitro amyloid formation by islet 
amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a peptide hormone whose amyloid formation is 
involved in type-2 diabetes. Here, using YX-I-1 as a lead, we identified 
regulator-approved drugs with similar structures by chemical similarity analysis 
and substructure searches and monitored the effect of 24 of these potential 
ligands on IAPP amyloid assembly in vitro. We show that one such compound, 
canagliflozin (Invokana), a type-2 diabetes drug already in clinical use, can 
strongly delay the kinetics of IAPP amyloid formation, an activity independent 
of its intended mode of action [sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitor] that may have important therapeutic implications. Combining analysis 
of amyloid self-assembly kinetics, biophysical characterization of monomer and 
fibril binding, and cryo-EM of the assembly products, we show that YX-I-1 and 
canagliflozin target IAPP early in aggregation, remodeling the energy landscape 
of primary nucleation and profoundly altering the resulting fibril structures. 
Early binding events thus imprint long-lasting effects on the amyloid structures 
that form.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a growing global health challenge as populations 
age. Recent research highlights the crucial role of peripheral immunity in AD 
pathogenesis. This review explores how blood-brain barrier disruption allows 
peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), 
worsening neuroinflammation and disease progression. We examine recent findings 
on interactions between peripheral immune cells and CNS-resident microglia, 
forming a self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle leading to neuronal dysfunction. 
Moreover, this review emphasizes recent developments in the dysregulation of 
immune factors from both the periphery and CNS, and their impact on AD 
progression. With ongoing research and development of new therapeutic 
strategies, this review underscores the importance of modulating interactions 
between the peripheral immune system and CNS in AD therapy.

BACKGROUND: Many available interventions to reduce challenges of natural 
caregivers of people living with dementia have limited efficacy since they do 
not meet the caregiver's individual needs. This study aims to evaluate 
caregivers' needs with the future goal of developing a tailored, multicomponent 
intervention to ease caregiver challenges through appropriate caregiver-centred 
interventions.
METHODS: Mixed method study using a convergent design with quantitative and 
qualitative data collection and analysis performed at similar times. For the 
cross-sectional quantitative study, questionnaires were sent to natural adult 
caregivers of a person with dementia identified by local healthcare 
professionals and general practitioners exercising in a rural and an urban 
department. For the qualitative descriptive study, individual caregiver 
interviews and healthcare professional focus groups were conducted in two 
primary healthcare territories in both departments. Data about screening for 
caregiver challenges and any help provided to the caregiver were collected. 
Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative 
data underwent thematic analysis using the grounded theory approach. 
Quantitative and qualitative results were described using a narrative discussion 
approach, then results were combined on a theme-by-theme basis using the weaving 
approach enabling integrated analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 199 general practitioners and 67 caregivers participated in 
the quantitative study. In the qualitative study, 10 caregivers from the urban 
area and 12 caregivers from the rural area participated in the individual 
interviews, and 9 healthcare professionals participated in the focus groups. Our 
broad categories of caregiver needs were identified: awareness and early 
diagnosis, information and training, practical, coordinated support, and 
psychological support. The integrated analysis highlighted areas for improvement 
in meeting these needs, especially a better identification of the caregiver 
role, caregiver distress, better information about what the caregiver has to 
expect in terms of the disease's progression and daily management, ways to 
improve awareness in general population, acceptation of practical support and 
its coordination and adaptation.
CONCLUSIONS: Identified needs were concordant with those in the literature. The 
mixed method used enabled expectations to be explored by analysing together the 
points of view of both patients and healthcare professionals in order to 
identify ways of improving their care.

As Alzheimer disease (AD) progresses, pathological tau spreads by cell-to-cell 
propagation of tau. This study aims to elucidate the impact of AD-associated 
post-translational modifications of tau-on-tau propagation. Tau propagation 
reporter constructs distinguishing donor cells from recipient cells were 
developed, and additional constructs were made with tau residues mutated from 
serine or threonine to aspartate to mimic the negative charge of a 
phosphorylation and/or from lysine to glutamine to mimic the charge-neutralizing 
effect of acetylation. Flow cytometry was used to quantify donor and recipient 
cells. This revealed that the mutations generally tended to reduce tau 
propagation compared to wildtype tau. Recombinant tau containing either wildtype 
or posttranslational modification mimicking mutations were used to treat Chinese 
hamster ovary cells or human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to 
quantify tau uptake, revealing that the mutations generally resulted in reduced 
uptake compared to wildtype tau. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that the 
mutations had a reduced affinity for lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 
(LRP1), a tau uptake receptor, compared to wildtype tau. Overall, these results 
suggest that AD-associated posttranslational modification mimicking mutations 
reduce the cell-to-cell propagation of tau by reducing tau uptake by recipient 
cells, which may be in part due to reduced binding affinity to LRP1.

therapeutic effect of inhaled seabuckthorn seed oil (SSO) on Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) remains not fully understood. This study explores the effects of nebulized 
inhalation of SSO in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice over 21 days. The results showed 
that nebulized SSO improved memory and cognition. Using 7.0T MRI to monitor 
blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals revealed that SSO altered the 
Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) 
signaling such as in the amygdala and substantia innominate, and hippocampus. 
Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) and pathological analyses indicated 
reduced neuroinflammation in plasma and brain, decreased neuronal necrosis, 
lower β-amyloid (Aβ) protein levels, reduced amyloid deposition, and increased 
tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Additionally, SSO promoted gut microbiota 
remodeling by increasing alpha diversity and boosting levels of probiotics such 
as Verrucomicrobia, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Akkermansia, without 
adverse effects on lung tissue. Nebulized inhalation of SSO may slow AD 
progression by modulating inflammation and amyloid deposition. Nebulized 
inhalation offered a potential method for enhancing drug delivery across the 
blood-brain barrier with reduced systemic side effects.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as 
groundbreaking therapeutic agents in managing a spectrum of metabolic disorders, 
demonstrating remarkable efficacy across multiple organ systems and disease 
states. These compounds are not only well-established in the treatment of type 2 
diabetes (T2D) and obesity-conditions for which they have received widespread 
approval-but also exhibit promising potential in addressing cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease 
(MASLD). Recent investigations have begun to illuminate the utility of GLP-1RAs 
in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D), as well as neurodegenerative 
disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and various behavioral 
disorders. A plethora of clinical trials have consistently validated the 
capacity of GLP-1RAs to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and 
mitigate cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with T2D and obesity. While 
their application in T1D remains limited due to safety concerns-particularly 
regarding the risks of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemic ketoacidosis-emerging data 
suggest that GLP-1RAs may offer hepatoprotective benefits, potentially reducing 
liver fat content and decelerating the progression of MASLD. The neuroprotective 
attributes of GLP-1 RAs have garnered significant interest, with research 
indicating their potential to alleviate cognitive decline associated with 
neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, preliminary findings highlight the role 
of GLP-1 RAs in addressing behavioral disorders, emphasizing their extensive 
therapeutic promise. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current evidence 
supporting the diverse therapeutic applications of GLP-1RAs, positioning them as 
"magic drug" therapies for metabolic and neurological disorders. As ongoing 
research continues to explore innovative applications and combinations of 
GLP-1RAs, the landscape of disease management in metabolic and neurological 
contexts is poised for transformative advancements. This review will also 
critically assess safety considerations and underscore the need for personalized 
treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes in these complex and often 
comorbid conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia and is 
emerging as a global threat to human health. Increased availability of processed 
food is identified as a crucial dietary risk factor underlying the prevalence of 
Alzheimer's disease. Carbon polymers (CPs), as neo-formed substances and 
ubiquitous in thermally processed foods, the relationship between them and AD 
onset remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The effect of CPs on AD onset was examined and the toxicological 
mechanisms of prolonged exposure to CPs derived from thermal processed foods on 
AD progression were comprehensively investigated using a scopolamine-induced 
neuroinflammatory cell models and the transgenic APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) AD 
mouse.
METHODS: The CPs were extracted from thermally processed foods and the effects 
of CPs exposure on oxidative stress in neuroinflammatory cells were evaluated 
using scopolamine-induced PC12 cells as a neuroinflammation model. Furthermore, 
APP/PS1 AD mice were used to validate the potential adverse impacts of prolonged 
exposure to CPs on AD progression through the Morris water maze and open field 
test. In addition, histopathological examination, including immunofluorescence, 
immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining, and H&E, of the brain tissue in AD mice 
after chronic CPs treatment was performed to elucidate the underlying risk of 
dietary exposure to CPs on AD progression.
RESULTS: Exposure to CPs enhanced oxidative damage in neuroinflammatory cells, 
as demonstrated by impaired mitochondrial function and activated NF-κB/MAPK 
signaling pathways. Further results from electron spin resonance substantiated 
the catalytic properties of CPs, which accelerated oxidative damage through 
promoting free radical generation. Using transgenic AD mice model, our findings 
also demonstrated that prolonged CPs exposure aggravated AD-associated 
pathology, as evidenced by increased amyloid-beta deposition and glial cell 
activation, ultimately accelerating cognitive decline.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide compelling evidence of the potential health 
risks associated with long-term dietary exposure to CPs and provide insight into 
the relationship between foodborne risk factors and neurodegenerative diseases.
