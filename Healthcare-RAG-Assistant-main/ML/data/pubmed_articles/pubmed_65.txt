The complexity of the human brain makes it challenging to understand the 
molecular mechanisms underlying brain function. Genome-wide association studies 
have uncovered variants associated with neurological phenotypes. Single-cell 
transcriptomics have provided descriptions of changes brain cells undergo during 
disease. However, these approaches do not establish molecular mechanism. To 
facilitate the scalable interrogation of causal molecular mechanisms in brain 
cell types, we developed a 3D co-culture system of induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPSC)-derived neurons and glia, termed iAssembloids. Using iAssembloids, we ask 
how glial and neuronal cells interact to control neuronal death and survival. 
Our CRISPRi-based screens identified that GSK3β inhibits the protective 
NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response elicited by high neuronal activity. We 
then investigate the role of APOE-ε4, a risk variant for Alzheimer's disease, on 
neuronal survival. We find that APOE-ε4-expressing astrocytes may promote 
neuronal hyperactivity as compared with APOE-ε3-expressing astrocytes. This 
platform allows for the unbiased identification of mechanisms of neuron-glia 
cell interactions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI), and vascular 
dementia (VD) are considered the most common causes of severe cognitive 
impairment in clinical practice. Numerous factors can influence their 
progression, and many studies have recently revealed that metabolic disorders 
play crucial roles in the progression of cognitive impairment. Mounting evidence 
indicate that the regulation of lipid metabolism is a major factor in 
maintaining brain homeostasis. Generally, abnormalities in lipid metabolism can 
affect amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and insulin 
resistance through lipid metabolic signaling cascades; affect the neuronal 
membrane structure, neurotransmitter synthesis and release; and promote synapse 
growth, which can impact neural signal transmission and exacerbate disease 
progression in individuals with cognitive impairment, including AD, DCI, and VD. 
Moreover, apolipoprotein E (APOE), a key protein in lipid transport, is involved 
in the occurrence and development of the aforementioned diseases by regulating 
lipid metabolism. The present article mainly discusses how lipid metabolic 
disorders in the brain microenvironment are involved in regulating the 
progression of cognitive impairment, and it explores the regulatory effects of 
targeting the key lipid transport protein APOE in the context of the role of 
lipid metabolism in the common pathogenesis of three diseases-Aβ deposition, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, and insulin resistance-which will help elucidate the 
potential of targeting lipid metabolism for the treatment of cognitive 
impairment.

Although the relationship between macroautophagy/autophagy and Alzheimer disease 
(AD) is widely studied, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, 
especially the regulatory role of the initiation signaling of autophagy on AD. 
Here, we find that the ER transmembrane protein CANX (calnexin) is a novel 
interaction partner of the autophagy-inducing kinase ULK1 and is required for 
ULK1 recruitment to the ER under basal or starved conditions. Loss of CANX 
results in the inactivity of ULK1 kinase and inhibits autophagy flux. In the 
brains of people with AD and APP-PSEN1 mice, the interaction of CANX and ULK1 
declines. In mice, the lack of CANX in hippocampal neurons causes the 
accumulation of autophagy receptors and neuron damage, which affects the 
cognitive function of C57BL/6 mice. Conversely, overexpression of CANX in 
hippocampal neurons enhances autophagy flux and partially contributes to 
improving cognitive function of APP-PSEN1 mice, but not the CANX variant lacking 
the interaction domain with ULK1. These findings reveal a novel role of CANX in 
autophagy activity and cognitive function by cooperating with ULK1.Abbreviation:

Alzheimer's disease is a gradually advancing neurodegenerative disease. 
According to the report by "World Health Organization (WHO)", there are over 55 
million individuals currently living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia 
globally, and the number of sufferers is increasing every day. In absence of 
effective cures and preventive measures, this number is predicted to triple by 
2050. The disease's origin is still unclear, and also no such treatment is 
available for eradicating the disease. Based on the crucial factors that are 
connected to the disease's progression, the authors developed several types of 
mathematical models. We review such mathematical models that are utilized to 
better understand the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Section-wise, we 
categorize the mathematical models in terms of different components that might 
be responsible for Alzheimer's disease. We explain the mathematical models with 
their descriptions and respective conclusions. In addition to mathematical 
models, we concentrate on biological aspects of the disease and possible 
therapeutic targets. We explore the disease's biological basis primarily to 
understand how proteins, glial cells, cytokines, genes, calcium signaling and 
oxidative stress contribute to the disease. We go through several treatment 
targets that might stop the progression of the disease or at least slow it down. 
We present a table that summarizes the mathematical models in terms of their 
formalisms, highlighting key components and important remarks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. 
Antiamyloid antibody treatments modestly slow disease progression in mild 
dementia due to AD. Emerging evidence shows that homeostatic dysregulation of 
the brain immune system, especially that orchestrated by microglia, plays an 
important role in disease onset and progression. Thus, a major question is how 
to modulate the phenotype and function of microglia to treat AD. Xenon (Xe) gas 
is a noble gas used in human patients as an anesthetic and a neuroprotectant 
used for treating brain injuries. Xe penetrates the blood-brain barrier, which 
could make it an effective therapeutic. To assess the effect of Xe on microglia 
and AD pathology, we designed a custom Xe inhalation chamber and treated several 
mouse models of AD with Xe gas. Xe treatment induced mouse microglia to adopt an 
intermediate activation state that we have termed pre-neurodegenerative 
microglia (pre-MGnD). This microglial phenotypic transition was observed in 
mouse models of acute neurodegeneration and amyloidosis (APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice) 
and tauopathy (P301S mice). This microglial state enhanced amyloid plaque 
compaction and reduced dystrophic neurites in the APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mouse 
models. Moreover, Xe inhalation reduced brain atrophy and neuroinflammation and 
improved nest-building behavior in P301S mice. Mechanistically, Xe inhalation 
induced homeostatic brain microglia toward a pre-MGnD state through IFN-γ 
signaling that maintained the microglial phagocytic response in APP/PS1 and 
5xFAD mice while suppressing the microglial proinflammatory phenotype in P301S 
mice. These results support the translation of Xe inhalation as an approach for 
treating AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neurodegenerative disorder primarily 
affecting individuals over the age of 65. It is characterized by impairments in 
memory, thinking, analytical judgment, visuospatial recognition, and mood. In 
recent years, the development of protein and peptide drugs targeting 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) has gained momentum, with several therapies entering clinical 
trials and even receiving marketing approval. Novel functional protein and 
peptide drugs, as the first-generation immunotherapeutic agents for 
neurodegenerative diseases, have pioneered cellular immunotherapy for AD. 
However, the currently available drugs are associated with toxicity issues, 
which can lead to serious complications such as cerebral hemorrhage or edema. 
Consequently, this study examines the potential for a new generation of 
Aβ-targeting drugs to mitigate the side effects of existing treatments and 
offers innovative perspectives for the advancement of therapies for AD.

Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
progressive decline in cognitive function and behaviour. Ginger is the rhizome 
of the plant Zingiber officinale Roscoe, has been an important ingredient of 
many Ayurveda formulations to treat neurological disorders. The present study 
aims to estimate the variation of 6-gingerol content in nine different ginger 
samples collected from Manipur, India, investigate the neuroprotective potential 
of the most potent ginger sample against scopolamine-induced cognitively 
impaired mice, and validate the therapeutic claim by molecular docking analysis. 
High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) analysis suggested that the 
sample GV6 had the highest 6-gingerol content with potent in vitro 
acetylcholnesterase (AChE) (IC50 = 336.10 µg/mL) and butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) (IC50 = 411.73 µg/mL) enzyme inhibitory activity. The neuroprotective 
potential of GV6 was tested in scopolamine-induced cognitively impaired mice 
(200 and 400 mg/kg). The behavioral analysis showed that GV6 alleviated the 
spatial recognition, and short-term and long-term memory in the experimental 
mice model. GV6 significantly improved brain AChE and BChE activity, 
acetylcholine (ACh) level, markedly alleviated the antioxidant parameters, and 
reversed the neuroinflammation. Brain histopathological observations confirmed 
the presence of organized nerve fibers, improvement of neuronal cell density, 
and reverse the nucleus shrinkage. Further molecular docking analysis showed 
that 6-gingerol and galantamine exhibited stable interaction with AChE (-7.5 and 
- 7.3 kcaL/moL) and BChE (-7.3 and - 8.5 kcaL/moL). The present study emphasizes 
the quality-related therapeutic importance of ginger samples from Northeast 
India and demonstrates that administration of GV6 may improve brain cognitive 
functions by restoring neurotransmitter levels and inflammatory and antioxidant 
parameters in scopolamine-induced cognitively impaired mice.

BACKGROUND: Circadian disruptions are increasingly recognized in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients and may influence disease onset and progression. This 
study examines how AD pathology affects blood-borne factors that regulate 
circadian rhythms.
METHODS: Eighty-five participants from the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive 
Decline were enrolled: 35 amyloid-beta negative normal controls (Aβ- NCs), 23 
amyloid-beta positive normal controls (Aβ+ NCs), 15 patients with amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 12 with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). 
Patients with aMCI and ADD were grouped as cognitively impaired (CI). Cellular 
circadian period length was assessed using a serum-based assay. Expression 
levels of clock genes in serum-treated cells and in leukocytes of participants 
were measured via real-time PCR. Plasma biomarkers were quantified using a 
single-molecule array immunoassay. Pineal parenchymal and hippocampal volumes 
were determined by magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: The cellular circadian period length was significantly extended by 
serum from CI patients than by that from Aβ- NCs (p < 0.01). Treatment of cells 
with serum from the CI patients resulted in suppressed expression of the clock 
genes Bmal1 and Nr1d1. Strong relationships between the expression levels of 
clock genes observed in leukocytes of the Aβ- NC group did not appear in those 
of the Aβ+ NC or CI groups. The significant correlation of cellular circadian 
period length and the pineal volume was only observed in the Aβ- NC group, but 
not in the Aβ+ NC or CI groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the presence of significant changes in 
blood-borne factors that could affect the circadian rhythms in AD, starting even 
at preclinical stages. These alterations could precede cognitive decline and 
contribute to AD pathogenesis.

Addressing Healthy Aging: Time to Stop a Tsunami of Rising Alzheimer's Disease.

Zong NC, Zhang Y, Huang Y, Cai H.

Alzheimer's disease [AD] disproportionately affects our seniors, diminishing 
their health and life expectancy. As the world population grows older, the 
collective burden of AD has become unsustainable. Globally, there were 43.8 
million patients in 2016, with a projection of affecting 152 million by 2050. 
Recent discoveries have shown that molecular changes characteristic to AD 
manifested 20 years before discernable neurological phenotypes emerge. It is 
feasible to halt or reverse this pathological process before reaching an 
irremediable stage. To take advantage of this treatment window, we need to make 
rapid progress in early detection and monitoring, targeted implementation of 
preventative measures, invention of novel therapeutics, and pragmatic ramping-up 
of relevant supporting policies. PET is a powerful tool for prognosis. The 
utilization of AI technology, on the other hand, has favorable features of low 
cost per capita, easy dissemination and broad scale data collection to uncover 
previously unknown hotspots or risk factors. FDA approved drugs, lecanemab and 
donanemab, have started to show efficacy to put a pause on AD progression. 
Additional clinical data will enable comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of 
these drugs. Gene therapy holds the potential of eliciting long term protection, 
while several candidate loci have been identified. The urgency of a tsunami of 
rising AD epidemiology demands rapid actions on all fronts of advanced 
diagnostics, monitoring, preventative and interventive strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia, is associated with 
significant respiratory dysfunctions. Our study explores the role of 
astrogliosis in the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a key breathing 
regulatory center, and its impact on breathing control and AD pathology in mice. 
Using Tg-2576 AD and wild-type mice, we investigated the effect of silencing the 
transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (TGFβR II) in the RTN. We performed 
behavioral tests, including the Barnes maze and novel object recognition test, 
along with whole-body plethysmography to assess breathing disorders. Our results 
showed that AD mice exhibited increased apneas and cognitive impairment, which 
were significantly mitigated following TGFβR II gene silencing. 
Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated levels of GFAP and TGFβR II in the RTN of 
AD mice, which were reduced post-gene silencing, alongside a decrease in 
amyloid-beta expression in the cortex and hippocampus. These findings suggest 
that targeting astrogliosis and improving respiratory control may offer a novel 
therapeutic avenue for managing Alzheimer's disease. Our study provides the 
first mechanistic insights into how TGFβ signaling influences both respiratory 
control and AD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential benefits of stabilizing 
breathing patterns in AD treatment.

Autophagy in microglia is essential for the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and 
amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. However, reports regarding the levels of 
autophagy in microglia have been inconsistent; some studies indicate an early 
enhancement followed by a subsequent reduction, while others describe a 
persistently weakened state. Notably, there is a lack of systematic studies 
documenting the temporal changes in microglial autophagy. TBC1D15, a Rab GTPase, 
plays a crucial role in lysosomal membrane repair, yet its function in 
regulating microglial autophagy in Alzheimer's disease remains unexplored. 
Current research suggests that microglial autophagy is activated in 3-month-old 
AD mice but gradually decreases by 12 months of age. Furthermore, TBC1D15 levels 
are significantly elevated in the lysosomes of microglia in Alzheimer's disease. 
Silencing TBC1D15 markedly inhibits swelling and Aβ phagocytosis in BV2 cells 
following Aβ treatment while simultaneously promoting autophagy and lysophagy. 
LIMP II/ATG8-TBC1D15-Dynamin2/RAB7 might participate in lysosome swelling of 
microglia in AD. These findings indicate that TBC1D15 in microglia is critical 
for the decline of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease. It is suggested that 
targeting microglial TBC1D15 may be an important strategy for enhancing 
autophagy, which facilitates the clearance of amyloid plaques as a therapeutic 
approach for Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Deciphering the diverse molecular mechanisms in living Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients is a big challenge but is pivotal for disease prognosis 
and precision medicine development.
METHODS: Utilizing an optimal transport approach, we conducted graph-based 
mapping of transcriptomic profiles to transfer AD subtype labels from ROSMAP 
monocyte samples to ADNI and ANMerge peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
Subsequently, differential expression followed by comparative pathway and 
diffusion pseudotime analysis were applied to each cohort to infer the 
progression trajectories. Survival analysis with real follow-up time was used to 
obtain potential biomarkers for AD prognosis.
RESULTS: AD subtype labels were accurately transferred onto the blood samples of 
ADNI and ANMerge living patients. Pathways and associated genes in neutrophil 
degranulation-like immune process, immune acute phase response, and IL-6 
signaling were significantly associated with AD progression.
DISCUSSION: The work enhanced our understanding of AD progression in different 
subtypes, offering insights into potential biomarkers and personalized 
interventions for improved patient care.
HIGHLIGHTS: We applied an innovative optimal transport-based approach to map 
transcriptomic data from different Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort studies and 
transfer known AD subtype labels from ROSMAP monocyte samples to peripheral 
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples within ADNI and ANMerge cohorts. Through 
comprehensive trajectory and comparative analysis, we investigated the molecular 
mechanisms underlying different disease progression trajectories in AD. We 
validated the accuracy of our AD subtype label transfer and identified 
prognostic genetic markers associated with disease progression, facilitating 
personalized treatment strategies. By identifying and predicting distinctive AD 
subtypes and their associated pathways, our study contributes to a deeper 
understanding of AD heterogeneity.

In 2024, therapeutic and diagnostic advancements are shaping the field of 
neurology. Three new drugs show promise for treating myasthenia gravis and 
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. A new classification for 
Parkinson's disease has been proposed, while a neuroprosthesis is improving gait 
in advanced stages. Revised criteria for inclusion body myositis and multiple 
sclerosis are refining diagnoses, and blood biomarkers are enabling early 
detection of Alzheimer's disease. The effectiveness of early thrombolysis in 
stroke has been confirmed, and new treatments are being explored for cerebral 
hemorrhages. In epilepsy, surgery reduces mortality by 30% in drug-resistant 
patients. Finally, new treatments targeting PACAP and CGRP are reducing 
refractory migraines with good tolerability.

BACKGROUND: While aerobic exercises have demonstrated efficacy in slowing 
cognitive decline and improving psychological symptoms associated with cognitive 
impairments, they may not be feasible due to multiple disabilities. Other gentle 
exercises with mindful approaches, such as "Yoga-like", have been explored but 
lack clear evidence.
AIM: To assess the efficacy of a "Yoga-like" intervention on cognitive and 
psychological features in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease (AD).
METHODS: We propose a randomized controlled trial design. Patients with mild to 
moderate AD who are able to undergo neurocognitive assessment and do not have 
conditions contraindicating deep breathing or extreme postures will be randomly 
assigned to an intervention group (IG: Yoga-like) or a control group (CG: no 
intervention). The 'Yoga-like' intervention consists of 30 minutes of exercises 
combining breathing, postures, concentration, and meditation, conducted three 
times a week over eight weeks. Both groups will undergo neuropsychological tests 
at baseline and after eight weeks, including attention, problem-solving, 
visuospatial abilities, mood and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
EXPECTED RESULTS: It is anticipated that the breathing, concentration, and 
meditation components of the intervention will improve attention, 
problem-solving abilities and behavioral symptoms. The postural components are 
expected to enhance visuospatial control and balance.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to identify cognitive tests that optimally relate 
to tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal in the inferior temporal cortex 
(ITC), a neocortical region associated with early tau accumulation in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the harvard aging brain study 
(HABS) (n = 128) and the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) 
study (n = 393). We used elastic net regression to identify the most robust 
cognitive correlates of tau PET signal in the ITC. Secondary analyses examined 
whether the cognitive correlates remained significantly associated with tau 
after adjusting for structural brain measures.
RESULTS: Episodic memory measures, including both total and "process" scores, 
were the most robust correlates of ITC tau across both cohorts. These cognitive 
test scores remained significant after accounting for structural brain measures.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the potential of specific episodic memory 
test scores to detect and monitor neuropathological changes associated with 
early AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Machine learning identified cognitive correlates of early 
Alzheimer's disease tau burden.Both traditional and process scores predicted 
early tau burden.Episodic memory scores were among the strongest 
correlates.Cognitive scores remained significant after accounting for structural 
brain measures.

INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the association between modifiable factors 
and symptom progression in dementia over up to 8 years.
METHODS: Multilevel growth curve models assessed the role of modifiable risk 
factors (low education, hearing impairment and its treatment, depression, 
physical inactivity, diabetes and its treatment, smoking, hypertension and its 
treatment, obesity, alcohol consumption, social isolation, and visual 
impairment) on cognitive and functional trajectories in 353 people with 
dementia.
RESULTS: Higher education was associated with higher initial cognitive status 
but faster decline. Antidiabetic medication was associated with slower cognitive 
decline, whereas depression and visual impairment were linked to low baseline 
functioning and faster cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: Several modifiable risk factors influenced symptom progression. 
Education initially had a protective effect, whereas depressive symptoms were 
linked to worse symptom progression. Treatment of comorbidities (diabetes, 
visual impairment) could have a positive impact on dementia symptoms. Modifiable 
risk factors are promising targets for tertiary prevention.
HIGHLIGHTS: Modifiable risk factors were associated with symptom progression in 
dementia over up to 8 years.More education was associated with higher initial 
cognitive status but faster decline.Depressive symptoms were linked to less 
favorable symptom progression.Treatment of comorbidities (diabetes, visual 
impairment) may positively impact the course of symptoms.Modifiable risk factors 
are promising targets for tertiary prevention.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative dementia, 
marked by progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment. Despite advances 
in therapeutic research, single-target-directed treatments often fall short in 
addressing the complex, multifactorial nature of AD. This arises from various 
pathological features, including amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregate deposition, metal ion 
dysregulation, oxidative stress, impaired neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal cell death. This review illustrates 
their interrelationships, with a particular emphasis on the interplay among Aβ, 
metal ions, and AD-related enzymes, such as β-site amyloid precursor protein 
cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), lysyl oxidase-like 
2 (LOXL2), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB). We 
further underscore the potential of therapeutic strategies that simultaneously 
inhibit Aβ aggregation and address other pathogenic mechanisms. These approaches 
offer a more comprehensive and effective method for combating AD, overcoming the 
limitations of conventional therapies.

Repurposing of drugs through nanocarriers (NCs) based platforms has been a 
recent trend in drug delivery research. Various routine drugs are now being 
repurposed to treat challenging neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer 
disease (AD). AD, at present is one of the challenging neurodegenerative 
disorders characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β and 
intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles. In spite of catchy 
progress in drug development, effective treatment outcome in AD patients is 
far-fetched dream. Out of several proposed hypothesis in the development and 
progression of AD, potential role of microorganisms causing dementia and AD 
cannot be ruled out. Several recent researches have been documented a clear 
correlation in between microbial infection and neuronal damage leading to 
progression of AD. Thus, antimicrobial drugs repurposing has been emerged as 
alternate, potential, cost-effective strategy to check progression of AD. 
Further, for efficient delivery of antimicrobial drugs to brain tissue, novel 
NCs based platforms are the preferred option to bypass blood-brain barrier. 
Several polymeric and lipid NCs have been extensively studied over the past 
years to improve antimicrobial drug delivery to brain. The present review 
encompasses various repurposing strategy of antimicrobial drugs delivered 
through various NCs to target AD. Evidence-based research outcome compiled from 
authentic database like Scopus, PubMed, Web of science have been pooled to 
provide an updated review. Side by side some light has been thrown on the 
practical problems faced by nanodrug carriers during technology transfer.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) impacts millions of elderly adults worldwide causing 
cognitive decline and severe deterioration of activities of daily life. The 
popular causal hypotheses for several decades include beta-amyloid (Aβ) 
deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. AD research and more than 34% of 
clinical trials in AD are based on these two hypotheses. A phase-III clinical 
trial of lecanemab in early AD and mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients 
reported a delay in cognitive decline of 27% over an 18-month treatment 
schedule. This multicenter trial found high specificity of lecanemab toward 
toxic protofibrils and subsequent clearance of beta-amyloid. There were, 
however, adverse events, which included cerebral edema and intracerebral 
hemorrhages in 23.1% of patients compared to 9.3% for those who received a 
placebo. Suboptimal clinical outcomes, brain volume loss, and adverse events in 
lecanemab treatment prompted a search for an alternative etiopathogenic 
explanation. Our research and others have focused on the oxidative stress (OS) 
hypothesis in AD. Autopsy studies have found significant depletion of the master 
antioxidant glutathione (GSH) in the hippocampal region, and is believed to be 
an early event in AD progression. Hippocampal GSH depletion is positively 
correlated with memory impairment. We have confirmed non-invasively with 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) the depletion of GSH in patients with MCI 
and AD. We therefore propose a combinational therapy involving oral 
supplementation of gamma-glutamylcysteine (GGC), an early precursor of 
glutathione, to replenish brain GSH in addition to lecanemab, potentially to 
maximize desirable outcomes from combined therapeutic approach.

Aggregation of microtubule-associated tau protein is a distinct hallmark of 
several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia 
with Lewy bodies (DLB), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Tau oligomers 
are suggested to be the primary neurotoxic species that initiate aggregation and 
propagate prion-like structures. Furthermore, different diseases are shown to 
have distinct structural characteristics of aggregated tau, denoted as 
polymorphs. Here, we investigate the structural and functional differences of 
amplified brain-derived tau oligomers (aBDTOs) from AD, DLB, and PSP. Our 
results indicate that the aBDTOs possess different structural and morphological 
features that impact neuronal function, gene regulation, and ultimately disease 
progression. The distinct tau oligomeric polymorphs may thus contribute to the 
development of clinical phenotypes and shape the progression of diseases. Our 
results can provide insight into developing personalized therapy to target a 
specific neurotoxic tau polymorph.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the population of Medicare beneficiaries with 
both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD).
METHODS: Using data from Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries aged 65 
and over identified through 2011-2019 Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF), we 
estimated the size, growth, and racial-ethnic characteristics of the ADRD and 
CKD populations. Individuals were classified as having ADRD and CKD based on CMS 
Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW) indicators in the MBSF Chronic 
Conditions file.
RESULTS: Among FFS beneficiaries, the prevalence of CKD has increased from 17.5% 
in 2011 to 27.9% in 2019, and the prevalence of ADRD has decreased over that 
time from 13.3 to 12.5%. The prevalence of individuals with co-morbid ADRD and 
CKD has risen from 4.4 to 6.3% which represents 1.72 million older adults. Black 
and Hispanic individuals have the highest prevalence of co-morbid CKD and ADRD, 
averaging 10.0% and 9.0% in 2019, respectively, compared to other racial-ethnic 
groups (≤ 7.2% all others). In addition, among those previously diagnosed with 
ADRD, the proportion with co-morbid CKD has been steadily increasing from 25.5% 
in 2011 to 44.4% in 2019. While the proportion of individuals with ADRD who have 
co-morbid CKD has increased across all race-ethnicities, it is highest in Black 
and Hispanic individuals (56.7 and 51%, respectively in 2019).
CONCLUSION/RELEVANCE: The prevalence of Medicare FFS enrollees with both ADRD 
and CKD is increasing. Although the ADRD prevalence has declined, there is a 
rising number of individuals with CKD who are diagnosed with ADRD and a rising 
proportion of those with ADRD who also have CKD. Due to shared clinical and 
demographic risk factors, interventions to reduce CKD progression could also 
delay ADRD onset. In patients with both advanced ADRD and advanced CKD, 
clinicians and policymakers should focus on treatment options that consider both 
co-morbidities.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of idiopathic neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer 
disease and Huntington disease. Familial forms of Parkinson disease and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are often characterized by mutations in genes 
associated with mitophagy deficits. Therefore, enhancing the mitophagy pathway 
may represent a novel therapeutic approach to targeting an underlying pathogenic 
cause of neurodegenerative diseases, with the potential to deliver 
neuroprotection and disease modification, which is an important unmet need. 
Accumulating genetic, molecular and preclinical model-based evidence now 
supports targeting mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite clinical 
development challenges, small-molecule-based approaches for selective mitophagy 
enhancement - namely, USP30 inhibitors and PINK1 activators - are entering phase 
I clinical trials for the first time.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with elevated dementia 
risk, while few studies have examined the role of the optimal glycemic status in 
disease trajectories of AF and dementia.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to evaluate associations between glycemic status with disease 
trajectories of AF and dementia, as well as major dementia subtypes, including 
Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.
SETTING: UK Biobank.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 458 368 participants who were free of prevalent 
dementia and AF at baseline, with complete glycemic status assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Based on clinical recommendations, we categorized glycemic status 
as low-normal (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] <5.5 %), normal (HbA1c 5.5 to 5.9 %), 
pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6.0 to 6.4 %), diabetes with HbA1c<7 %, and diabetes with 
HbA1c≥7 %. Outcomes including AF, dementia (all-cause and sub-type dementia), 
and death were ascertained via linkage to external registry databases. A 
multi-state survival analysis was conducted to evaluate disease trajectories of 
AF and dementia.
RESULTS: Better glycemic status was consistently associated with decreased 
hazards of trajectories of AF and dementia, including progression from AF to the 
comorbidity of AF and dementia. Among people with diabetes, those with HbA1c<7 % 
had a 31 % lower hazard (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95 % confidence intervals 
[CI], 0.51-0.93) of progression from incident AF to dementia comorbidity, 
compared to those with HbA1c≥7 %. Similar risk reductions were found in 
individuals with pre-diabetes, normal HbA1c, and low-normal HbA1c, respectively. 
Strong dose-response associations were observed, with each 1 % increment in 
HbA1c related to a 28 % higher hazard of progression from AF to dementia 
comorbidity (HR,1.28; 95 % CI, 1.19-1.37). The glycemic status was most relevant 
for associations with disease trajectories of AF and vascular dementia, compared 
to trajectories of AF and Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The better glycemic status was consistently associated with lower 
hazards of disease trajectories of AF and dementia, including the reduced risk 
of progression from incident AF to comorbidity of AF and dementia. These 
findings support the significance of reaching optimal glycemic status to 
alleviate the huge disease burden of both AF and dementia simultaneously.

BACKGROUND: Research suggest that mind-body movement programs have beneficial 
effects on cognitive outcomes for older adults with cognitive decline. However, 
few studies have directly compared specific approaches to mind-body movement or 
studied the impact of remote program delivery.
METHODS: In a 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) for older adults with 
cognitive impairment, we are comparing a multidomain mind-body program that 
emphasizes movement, body awareness, personal meaningfulness, and social 
connection, and a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise (Tai Chi) to a health 
and wellness education control condition. All 3 interventions are delivered 
remotely two times per week (onehour per session) for 12 weeks. The two active 
interventions are live-streamed. Outcomes are assessed prior to, after, and 
6-months after the interventions. The co-primary outcomes are changes on the 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) and brain 
functional connectivity in the Default Mode Network (DMN). Secondary outcomes 
include measures of specific cognitive domains (e.g., executive function, 
attention), mobility, and self-report measures of general well-being, quality of 
life, social engagement, self- and attention-regulation.
CONCLUSION: This RCT will directly compare the effects of two mind-body movement 
programs versus an education control delivered remotely over 12 weeks on 
cognitive, neuroimaging, and participant-reported outcomes. If successful, these 
programs may provide scalable strategies for slowing cognitive decline, which 
could potentially delay dementia onset in some individuals.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) increasingly affects aged individuals, where functional 
impairment and mortality are highest. However, the aging-dependent mechanisms 
underpinning tissue damage remain elusive. Here, we find that natural 
killer-like T (NKLT) cells seed the intact aged human and murine spinal cord and 
multiply further after injury. NKLT cells accumulate in the spinal cord via 
C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 and ligand 16 signaling to clonally expand by 
engaging with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I-expressing myeloid cells. 
NKLT cells expressing natural killer cell granule protein 7 (Nkg7) disrupt 
myeloid-cell-dependent wound healing in the aged injured cord. Nkg7 deletion in 
mice curbs NKLT cell degranulation to normalize the myeloid cell phenotype, thus 
promoting tissue repair and axonal integrity. Monoclonal antibodies neutralizing 
CD8+ T cells after SCI enhance neurological recovery by promoting wound healing. 
Our results unveil a reversible role for NKG7+CD8+ NKLT cells in exacerbating 
tissue damage, suggesting a clinically relevant treatment for SCI.

While cognitive impairment has been documented in ulcerative colitic patients, 
the possible influence of central β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) signaling on 
this extraintestinal manifestation remains unclear. Previously, we identified an 
imperative role for mirabegron (MA) as an agonist of β3-AR, in decreasing the 
BACE-1/beta-amyloid (Aβ) cue in the colons of UC rats. Consequently, we 
investigated its therapeutic potential for alleviating cognitive impairment 
associated with UC. To fulfil our aim, rats administered iodoacetamide were 
treated with the β3-AR agonist (MA) alone, with the antagonist (SR59230A) for 8 
days, or kept untreated. The animals' behavior (MWM and NOR tests) and 
hippocampal structure were assessed. Mechanistically, necroptosis, ER stress 
(ERS), Aβ-amyloidosis, inflammation/oxidative burden, and gut/BBB dysfunction 
were analyzed. Post-administration of MA improved weight gain, colon/hippocampal 
structures, and memory. Additionally, it inhibited serum levels of 
lipopolysaccharide and Annexin-1, indicating recovered gut and BBB integrity. MA 
turned off the pathogenic BACE-1/Aβ axis in the hippocampus, necroptosis 
trajectory (TNFR-1/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL), and the IRE-1α/JNK signal. Moreover, MA 
enhanced the transcription factor PPAR-γ, decreased NF-κΒ/TNF-α inflammatory 
hub, and modulated the redox imbalance by decreasing malondialdehyde and 
increasing catalase. Notably, MA's behavioral, structural, and molecular 
beneficial actions were hindered by the pre-administration of SR59230A. From a 
novel standpoint, we recognized the β3-AR as a therapeutic target for 
UC-associated cognitive impairment in the hippocampus. In this context, the 
aptitude of MA to inhibit UC-induced hippocampal amyloidogenesis, alongside its 
anti-necroptotic, anti-ERS, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, 
contribute to these central enhancements, while also regulating permeability in 
both gut and BBB barriers.

Recently study has found a new form of copper-dependent death called 
cuproptosis, which differs from apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necrosis. The main 
process of cuproptosis is copper directly combined with lipid-acetylated 
proteins in the TCA cycle of mitochondrial response, leading to the aggregation 
of lipid-acetylated proteins and the loss of Fe-S cluster proteins, resulting in 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventually causing cell death. Previous studies 
demonstrated that an imbalance in copper homeostasis exacerbates the 
pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the induction of 
oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and the accumulation of Aβ deposition 
and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. However, the underlying mechanisms remains 
to be elucidated. More importantly, research identifies the role of cuproptosis 
and further elucidates the underlying molecular mechanisms in AD. This review 
summarized the effects of copper metabolism on AD pathology, the characteristics 
and mechanism of cuproptosis and we discuss the significance of cuproptosis in 
the pathogenesis of AD.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of Cyclo-Z, a 
combination of Cyclo (His-Pro) plus zinc, on hepatic sphingolipid (SL) 
metabolism and antioxidant properties in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD).
METHODS: Alzheimer's disease rat model created via intracerebroventricular 
(i.c.v.) amyloid beta-42 oligomer (AβO) injection into the lateral ventricles. 
Cyclo-Z administration was performed with daily gavage for 3 weeks after the AβO 
injection. Ceramide, ceramide kinase (CERK), sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P), 
glutathione (GSH), total oxidant capacity (TOS), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and 
caspase-3 levels were measured with Elisa kit in liver tissue.
RESULTS: S1P, CERK and GSH levels increased and ceramide, TOS, 4 HNE, and 
caspase-3 levels decreased in the liver tissues of AD group. Cyclo-Z treatment 
decreased S1P, CERK, ceramide and caspase-3 levels but increased TOS and 4-HNE 
levels in the liver tissues of AD group.
CONCLUSION: These results showed that SL metabolism was modulated to generate an 
anti-apoptotic defense system in liver tissue of AD rats.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with cognitive impairments which are 
linked to a deficit in cholinergic function. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the ability of TeMac™ to prevent memory impairment in scopolamine-rats 
model of Alzheimer's disease and by in silico approaches to identify molecules 
in TeMac™ inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. The cholinergic cognitive dysfunction 
was induced by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg daily) in male 
Wistar rats for seven consecutive days. TeMac™ at 400 mg/kg body weight was 
orally administrated 60 min after scopolamine. Donepezil was used as a reference 
drug. The cognitive deficits were assessed by the Morris Water Maze and novel 
object recognition tests. After killing the rats, brains were immediately 
collected and used to carry out cholinesterase enzyme activity and 
histopathological analyses. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 
characterization of the TeMac™ was carried out and the identified molecules were 
tested in silico for their ability to cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and 
inhibit acetylcholinesterase using molecular docking. The administration of the 
TeMac™ led to the prevention of memory deficits in rats by reducing 
significantly the cholinesterase enzymes activities and protecting against 
morphological alterations and loss of neurons in hippocampus. Seven major 
compounds were identified in TeMac™. Molecular docking simulations confirm the 
ability of oleaterminaloic acid B and stigmasterol to cross the BBB and interact 
with peripheral site and the acyl pocket of acetylcholinesterase. All these 
observations suggest that TeMac™ can therefore be used as an alternative for the 
management of AD-related cognitive impairments.

Neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are early events in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. 
Evidence suggests that the inflammatory axis mediated by macrophage migration 
inhibitory factor (MIF) binding to its receptor, CD74, plays an important role 
in many central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as AD. Our group has 
developed DRhQ, a novel CD74 binding construct which competitively inhibits MIF 
binding, blocks macrophage activation and migration into the CNS, enhances 
anti-inflammatory microglia cell numbers and reduces pro-inflammatory gene 
expression. Here, we evaluate its effects in amyloid-β (Aβ) overexpressing mice. 
5xFAD mice and their wild type littermates were treated with DRhQ (100 µg) or 
vehicle for 4 weeks. DRhQ improved cognition and cortical mitochondrial function 
in both male and female 5xFAD mice. Aβ plaque burden in 5xFAD animals was not 
robustly impacted by DRhQ treatment in either the hippocampus or the cortex. 
Cortical microglial activation was similarly not apparently affected by DRhQ 
treatment, although in the hippocampus there was evidence of a reduction in 
activated microglia for female 5xFAD mice. Future studies are needed to confirm 
this possible sex-dependent response on microglial activation, as well as to 
optimize the dose and timing of DRhQ treatment and gain a better understanding 
of its mechanism of action in AD.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive and age-associated neurodegenerative 
disorder, is primarily characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles. Despite advances in targeting Aβ-mediated neuronal 
damage with anti-Aβ antibodies, these treatments provide only symptomatic relief 
and fail to address the multifactorial pathology of the disease. This 
necessitates the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches and a deeper 
understanding of molecular signaling mechanisms underlying AD. 
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs), particularly Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), play a 
pivotal role in regulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a key molecule 
involved in memory consolidation and cognitive function. PDE4 inhibitors have 
demonstrated potential in enhancing memory and cognition in preclinical models 
of AD by modulating cAMP signaling. However, their clinical translation has been 
limited due to challenges such as adverse effects, narrow therapeutic windows, 
and low specificity in mechanism of action. This review bridges the gap between 
preclinical discoveries and clinical applications of PDE4 inhibitors in AD. It 
highlights preclinical evidence supporting the neuroprotective and 
anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4 inhibitors while addressing challenges in 
their clinical development, including issues of safety, efficacy, and 
disease-specific targeting. By integrating findings from both preclinical and 
clinical studies, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic 
potential of PDE4 inhibitors in AD. Furthermore, this review outlines future 
research directions aimed at optimizing PDE4 inhibition strategies for AD 
treatment, offering a roadmap to translate foundational insights into clinical 
realities.

INTRODUCTION: Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is increasingly being 
investigated as a promising potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Although the safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of TPS short pulses have 
been supported by neuropsychological scores in treated AD patients, its 
fundamental mechanisms are uncharted.
METHODS: Herein, we used a multi-modal preclinical imaging platform combining 
real-time volumetric optoacoustic tomography, contrast-enhanced magnetic 
resonance imaging, and ex vivo immunofluorescence to comprehensively analyze 
structural and hemodynamic effects induced by TPS. Cohorts of healthy and AD 
transgenic mice were imaged during and after TPS exposure at various per-pulse 
energy levels.
RESULTS: TPS enhanced the microvascular network, whereas the blood-brain barrier 
remained intact following the procedure. Notably, higher pulse energies were 
necessary to induce hemodynamic changes in AD mice, arguably due to their 
impacted vessels.
DISCUSSION: These findings shed light on cerebrovascular dynamics induced by TPS 
treatment, and hence are expected to assist improving safety and therapeutic 
outcomes.
HIGHLIGHTS: ·Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) facilitates transcranial wave 
propagation using short pulses to avoid tissue heating. ·Preclinical multi-modal 
imaging combines real-time volumetric optoacoustic (OA) tomography, 
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI), and ex vivo 
immunofluorescence to comprehensively analyze structural and hemodynamic effects 
induced by TPS. ·Blood volume enhancement in microvascular networks was 
reproducibly observed with real-time OA imaging during TPS stimulation. ·CE-MRI 
and gross pathology further confirmed that the brain architecture was maintained 
intact without blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening after TPS exposure, thus 
validating the safety of the procedure. ·Higher pulse energies were necessary to 
induce hemodynamic changes in AD compared to wild-type animals, arguably due to 
their pathological vessels.

Limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change 
(LATE-NC) is highly prevalent in late life and a common co-pathology with 
Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). LATE-NC is a slowly 
progressive, amnestic clinical syndrome. Alternatively, when present with ADNC, 
LATE-NC is associated with a more rapid course. With the emergence of 
anti-amyloid therapeutics, discrimination of LATE-NC from ADNC is critical and 
will lead to greater clinical recognition of amnestic patients without ADNC. 
Furthermore, co-pathology with LATE-NC may influence outcomes of these 
therapeutics. Thus there is a need to identify patients during life with likely 
LATE-NC. We propose criteria for clinical diagnosis of LATE as an initial 
framework for further validation. In the context of progressive memory loss and 
substantial hippocampal atrophy, criteria are laid out for probable (amyloid 
negative) or possible LATE (amyloid biomarkers are unavailable or when amyloid 
is present, but hippocampal neurodegeneration is out of proportion to expected 
pure ADNC). HIGHLIGHTS: Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy 
(LATE) is a highly prevalent driver of neuropathologic memory loss in late life. 
LATE neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) is a common co-pathology with Alzheimer's 
disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and may influence outcomes with emerging 
disease-modifying medicines. We provide initial clinical criteria for diagnosing 
LATE during life either when LATE-NC is the likely primary driver of symptoms or 
when observed in conjunction with AD. Definitions of possible and probable LATE 
are provided.

Observational studies on the cancer-dementia relationship have yielded 
controversial results. This study systematically reviews the evidence to clarify 
this association. We searched Embase, Global Health, Ovid Medline, and APA 
PsycInfo. Colorectal and lung cancers showed the greatest risk reduction for 
all-cause dementia (ACD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively, while 
melanoma and colorectal cancers had the largest reduction in vascular dementia 
(VaD). Prostate cancer survivors on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) had a 
higher risk of ACD/AD, while breast cancer patients on tamoxifen had a lower AD 
risk. Chemotherapy was linked to a reduced AD risk. ACD patients saw a 30% risk 
reduction for bladder, colorectal, and lung cancers, while AD patients had a ≈ 
35% reduction for bladder and lung cancers. Our study urges clinicians to 
monitor cognitive function in cancer patients, especially those on ADT, 
tamoxifen, or chemotherapy and highlights the need for research into 
cancer-dementia mechanisms. HIGHLIGHTS: Cancer survivors have an 8% to 14% lower 
risk of dementia, while those with dementia have a 25% lower cancer risk. 
Colorectal and non-melanoma skin cancers were associated with reduced risks of 
all-cause dementia (ACD; 16%/9%), Alzheimer's disease (AD; 13%/5%), and vascular 
dementia (VaD; 24%/9%). Lung cancer reduced AD risk by 17%, and melanoma reduced 
VaD risk by 27%. ACD and AD patients had lower risks of lung (30%/36%), bladder 
(32%/34%), breast (26%/20%), and colorectal (31%/28%) cancers. Tamoxifen and 
chemotherapy reduced AD risk, while androgen deprivation therapy increased ACD 
risk.

INTRODUCTION: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) modulates 
γ-secretase in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although IFITM3 knockout reduces 
amyloid β protein (Aβ) production, its cell-specific effect on AD remains 
unclear.
METHODS: Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was used to assess IFITM3 
expression. Adeno-associated virus-BI30 (AAV-BI30) was injected to reduce IFITM3 
expression in the cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CVECs). The effects on AD 
phenotypes in cells and AD mice were examined through behavioral tests, 
two-photon imaging, flow cytometry, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR).
RESULTS: IFITM3 expression was increased in the CVECs of patients with AD. 
Overexpression of IFITM3 in primary endothelial cells enhanced Aβ generation 
through regulating beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Aβ 
further increased IFITM3 expression, creating a vicious cycle. Knockdown of 
IFITM3 in CVECs decreased Aβ accumulation within cerebrovascular walls, reduced 
Alzheimer's-related pathology, and improved cognitive performance in AD 
transgenic mice.
DISCUSSION: Knockdown of IFITM3 in CVECs alleviates AD pathology and cognitive 
impairment. Targeting cerebrovascular endothelial IFITM3 holds promise for AD 
treatment.
HIGHLIGHTS: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) expression was 
increased in the cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CVECs) of patients with 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cerebrovascular endothelial IFITM3 regulates amyloid β 
protein (Aβ) generation through regulating beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 
(BACE1) and γ-secretase. Knockdown of IFITM3 in CVECs reduces Aβ deposits and 
improves cognitive impairments in AD transgenic mice. Cerebrovascular 
endothelial IFITM3 could be a potential target for the treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Down syndrome (DS) is associated with 
changes in brain structure. It is unknown if thickness and volumetric changes 
can identify AD stages and if they are similar to other genetic forms of AD.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 178 DS adults (106 
nonclinical, 45 preclinical, and 27 symptomatic). Cortical thickness and 
subcortical volumes were compared between DS groups and evaluated as a staging 
metric using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Thickness patterns were 
compared to those previously reported in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD).
RESULTS: Decreased parietal and temporal lobe thickness differentiated amyloid 
positivity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and impairment (AUC = 0.81), and 
slightly outperformed subcortical volumes (AUC = 0.8/0.74). Thickness 
differences in DS were more widespread, severe, and had better discriminative 
ability than ADAD.
DISCUSSION: Cortical thickness can stage AD pathology in DS. Identification of 
brain regions affected by AD may aid in tracking disease course and evaluating 
treatment effects.
HIGHLIGHTS: DSAD is associated with reduced temporal and parietal cortical 
thickness. DSAD is associated with smaller hippocampal and striatal volumes. 
Thickness differences can stage DSAD better than other forms of AD. DSAD 
thickness differences are more extensive and severe than ADAD.

OBJECTIVES: Dementia, a growing concern globally, affects more than 55 million 
people-a number projected to rise to 152 million by 2050. Current medications 
target Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia. This study 
investigated Juniperus phoenicea L., a plant used in traditional Chinese 
medicine, as a potential inhibitor of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), 
an enzyme associated with dementia.
METHODS: J. phoenicea phytochemicals were subjected to in silico docking against 
PPT1 (PDB ID: 1EH5). Docking simulations were performed in YASARA Structure with 
VINA scoring. Top-ranked ligands were subjected to ADMET analysis (admetlab 2.0, 
Protox 3.0) and PASS bioactivity prediction. Stability and reactivity were 
analyzed with DFT calculations (Gaussian 09), and 500 ns MD simulations (YASARA 
Structure, AMBER 14 force field) to assess protein-ligand complex stability. 
MM-PBSA was used to calculate binding free energies.
RESULTS: The docking simulations identified amentoflavone (-9.6 kcal/mol) as the 
top hit, followed by ferruginol and quercetin 3-O-pentoside. Amentoflavone 
formed the most interactions (19) with PPT1. In silico toxicity analysis 
predicted amentoflavone and quercetin 3-O-pentoside to be safe, whereas 
ferruginol violated the Pfizer rule. The PASS server indicated a higher 
probability of activity for quercetin 3-O-pentoside (0.423) than amentoflavone 
(0.287) for dementia treatment. DFT calculations revealed similar electronic 
properties for both ligands, although amentoflavone showed slightly more 
favorable values. MD simulations demonstrated that amentoflavone, compared with 
to galantamine, had superior binding stability in the PPT1 binding pocket.
CONCLUSION: This in silico study was aimed at identifying potential inhibitors 
of PPT1 from J. phoenicea phytochemicals, given that PPT1 is a target for 
developing new dementia medications. Our findings identified amentoflavone as a 
promising candidate for further investigation. These findings warrant further 
research to validate this compound's potential as a PPT1 inhibitor for dementia 
treatment.

Publisher: أهداف البحث: يمثل الخرف مشكلة عالمية متزايدة، حيث يؤثر على أكثر من 55 
مليون شخص ومن المتوقع أن يرتفع إلى 152 مليون بحلول عام 2050. تستهدف الأدوية 
الحالية مرض الزهايمر، وهو أكثر أشكال الخرف شيوعا. تبحث هذه الدراسة في نبات 
العرعر الفينيقي، المستخدم في الطب الصيني التقليدي، كمثبط محتمل لإنزيم ثيوإستراز 
البروتين البالميتويلي 1، وهو إنزيم مرتبط بالخرف.
طرق البحث: استخدمت هذه الدراسة المركبات النباتية من العرعر الفينيقي للإرساء 
الحاسوبي ضد الإنزيم المستهدف. تم إجراء محاكاة الإرساء باستخدام برامج متخصصة. 
خضعت المركبات الأعلى تصنيفا لتحليل الامتصاص والتوزيع والأيض والإفراز والسمية، 
وتنبؤ النشاط البيولوجي. درست حسابات نظرية الكثافة الوظيفية الاستقرار والتفاعلية. 
قيمت محاكاة الديناميكا الجزيئية استقرار معقد البروتين-المركب لمدة 500 نانوثانية. 
تم حساب طاقات الارتباط الحرة.
النتائج: حددت محاكاة الإرساء مركب الأمنتوفلافون كأفضل مركب، يليه الفيروجينول 
وكيرستين بنتوسيد. شكل الأمنتوفلافون أكبر عدد من التفاعلات مع الإنزيم. توقع تحليل 
السمية الحاسوبي أن الأمنتوفلافون وكيرستين بنتوسيد آمنان، بينما خالف الفيروجينول 
القواعد المطلوبة. أشارت التحليلات إلى احتمالية أعلى لنشاط كيرستين بنتوسيد مقارنة 
بالأمنتوفلافون لعلاج الخرف. كشفت الحسابات النظرية عن خصائص إلكترونية متشابهة 
لكلا المركبين، مع قيم مواتية قليلا للأمنتوفلافون. أظهرت محاكاة الديناميكا 
الجزيئية استقرارا أفضل لارتباط الأمنتوفلافون مقارنة بالجالانتامين في موقع ارتباط 
الإنزيم.
الاستنتاجات: هدفت هذه الدراسة الحاسوبية إلى تحديد مثبطات محتملة للإنزيم من 
المركبات النباتية للعرعر الفينيقي، حيث يعد الإنزيم هدفا لتطوير أدوية جديدة 
للخرف. تسلط نتائجنا الضوء على الأمنتوفلافون كمركب واعد يستحق مزيدا من البحث.

The neurovascular unit (NVU) is highly responsible for cerebral homeostasis and 
its dysfunction emerges as a critical contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathology. Hence, rescuing NVU dysfunction might be a viable approach to AD 
treatments. Here, we fabricated a self-regulated muti-functional nano-modulator 
(siR/PIO@RP) that can intelligently navigate to damaged blood-brain barrier and 
release therapeutical cargoes for synergetic AD therapy. The resulting 
siR/PIO@RP enables self-regulation of its distribution in accordance with the 
physio/pathological state (low/high RAGE expression) of the target site via a 
feedback loop. siR/PIO@RP is capable of performing intricate tasks and goes 
beyond the capabilities of single-target therapeutic agents utilized in AD 
therapy, such as reducing cerebral Aβ load, relieving neuroinflammation, and 
alleviating the dysfunction of NVU. Overall, the current study provides proof of 
concept that normalizing NVU holds promise as a means of alleviating AD 
symptoms.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in both physiological and 
pathological processes. Under physiological conditions, appropriate amounts of 
ROS play an important role in signaling and regulation in cells. However, too 
much ROS can lead to many health problems, including inflammation, cancer, 
delayed wound healing, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's disease 
and Alzheimer's disease), and autoimmune diseases, and oxidative stress from 
excess ROS is also one of the most critical factors in the pathogenesis of 
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis. Hydrogen gas 
effectively removes ROS from the body due to its good antioxidant properties, 
and hydrogen therapy has become a promising gas therapy strategy due to its 
inherent safety and stability. The combination of nanomaterials can achieve 
targeted delivery and effective accumulation of hydrogen, and has some 
ameliorating effects on diseases. Herein, we summarize the use of 
hydrogen-producing nanomaterials for the treatment of ROS-related diseases and 
talk about the prospects for the treatment of other ROS-induced disease models, 
such as acute kidney injury.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge in developing effective 
treatments due to its complex pathophysiology, including the accumulation of 
amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology 
offers promise for targeted gene silencing, but effective delivery to the 
central nervous system remains a significant obstacle. Viral vectors have 
emerged as potent delivery vehicles for transporting siRNA to neural tissues. 
This review explores the utilization of viral vectors for siRNA delivery in AD, 
focusing on delivery strategies and challenges. We discuss the design and 
optimization of viral vectors, targeting strategies, and safety considerations. 
Additionally, we examine recent advancements and prospects for enhancing viral 
vector-mediated siRNA delivery in AD.

OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder, but no drugs can cure this disease. Chalcones possess good antioxidant 
activity, anti-neuroinflammatory activity, neuroprotective effects, inhibitory 
effects on Aβ aggregation, and Aβ disaggregation ability. Therefore, chalcones 
are ideal lead compounds, and the discovery of novel anti-AD agent-based 
chalcones is necessary.
METHODS: Hydroxy groups and aryl benzyl ether groups were introduced into 
chalcone scaffolds to obtain a series of 2-hydroxyl-4-benzyloxy chalcone 
derivatives. These derivatives were further synthesized, biologically evaluated, 
and docked.
RESULTS: Most target derivatives exhibited good anti-AD activities. In 
particular, compound 11d had excellent inhibitory effects on self-induced Aβ1-42 
aggregation (90.8% inhibition rate at 25 μM) and Cu2+ induced Aβ1-42 aggregation 
(93.4% inhibition rate at 25 μM). In addition, it also exhibited good Aβ1-42 
fibril disaggregation ability (64.7% at 25 μM), significant antioxidative 
activity (ORAC = 2.03 Trolox equivalent), moderate MAO-B inhibition (IC50 = 4.81 
μM), selective metal chelation, appropriate BBB permeation, and dramatic 
anti-neuroinflammatory ability. In addition, compound 11d relieved AD symptoms 
and protected hippocampal neurons in vivo.
CONCLUSION: Compound 11d is a promising multifunctional anti-Aβ agent.

BACKGROUND: The imbalance of glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
neurotransmitter system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Riluzole is a Glu modulator originally approved for amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis that has shown potential neuroprotective effects in various 
neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether riluzole can improve Glu and GABA 
homeostasis in AD brain and its related mechanism of action remain unknown. This 
study utilized chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging combined 
with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to monitor the dynamic 
changes of Glu and GABA in riluzole-treated AD mice, aiming to evaluate the 
efficacy and mechanism of riluzole in AD treatment.
METHODS: GluCEST, GABACEST and 1H-MRS were used to longitudinally monitor Glu 
and GABA levels in 3xTg AD mice treated with riluzole (12.5 mg/kg/day) or 
vehicle for 20 weeks. Magnetic resonance measurements were performed at 
baseline, 6, 12, and 20 weeks post-treatment. Cognitive performance was assessed 
using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) at baseline, 10, and 20 weeks. At the study 
endpoint, immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining, and Western blot were used to 
evaluate the brain pathology, neuronal survival, and protein expression.
RESULTS: GluCEST, GABACEST and 1H-MRS consistently revealed higher levels of Glu 
and GABA in the brain of riluzole-treated AD mice compared to untreated 
controls, which were associated with improvements in spatial learning and 
memory. The cognitive improvements significantly correlated with the increased 
GluCEST signals and Glu levels. Immunohistochemistry and Nissl staining 
demonstrated that riluzole treatment reduced amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, GFAP-positive astrocyte activation, and prevented neuronal 
loss. Moreover, riluzole upregulated the expression of excitatory amino acid 
transporter 2 (EAAT2), glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65/67), and 
glutamine synthetase (GS), suggesting enhanced neurotransmitter metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: CEST imaging combined with 1H-MRS demonstrated the effectiveness of 
riluzole in modulating Glu- and GABA-related changes and improving cognitive 
function in 3xTg AD mice, potentially through regulating key proteins involved 
in neurotransmitter metabolism. These findings suggest riluzole as a therapeutic 
agent for Alzheimer's disease and highlight the utility of multimodal MR imaging 
in monitoring treatment response and exploring disease mechanisms.

NMDAR antagonists, such as memantine and ketamine, have shown efficacy in 
treating neurodegenerative diseases and major depression. The mechanism by which 
these drugs correct the aforementioned diseases is still unknown. Our study 
reveals that these antagonists significantly enhance 20S proteasome activity, 
crucial for degrading intrinsically disordered, oxidatively damaged, or 
misfolded proteins, factors pivotal in neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In our mouse model experiment, ketamine 
administration notably altered brain synaptic protein profiles within two hours, 
significantly downregulating proteins strongly associated with Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases. Furthermore, the altered proteins exhibited enrichment in 
terms related to plasticity and potentiation, including retrograde 
endocannabinoid signaling-a pivotal pathway in both short- and long-term 
plasticity that may elucidate the long-lasting effects of ketamine in major 
depression. Via the ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome pathway (UIPS), these 
drugs maintain cellular protein homeostasis, which is crucial as proteasome 
activity declines with age, leading to protein aggregation and disease symptoms. 
Therefore, these findings hold promise for new treatment options not only for 
brain diseases but also for other systemic conditions associated with unfolded 
or misfolded proteins.

Ligustilide, a phthalide compound extracted from Umbelliferae plants such as 
Angelica sinensis and Ligusticum chuanxiong, has been proven to possess various 
pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, 
anti-atherosclerosis, anti-ischemic stroke injury, and anti-Alzheimer's disease 
properties. In recent years, it has shown great potential, particularly in the 
treatment of locomotor system diseases. Studies have shown that ligustilide has 
significant therapeutic effects on various locomotor system diseases, including 
osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, femoral head necrosis, osteosarcoma, and muscle 
aging and injury. Its mechanisms of action include enhancing the differentiation 
ability of osteoblasts(OBs), inhibiting the formation ability of 
osteoclasts(OCs), downregulating inflammatory factors, promoting the synthesis 
of extracellular matrix(ECM), improving local blood supply to the femoral head, 
balancing lipid metabolism, inhibiting the proliferation and migration of 
osteosarcoma cells, inducing cell cycle arrest, enhancing glucose utilization in 
skeletal muscle, and regulating autophagy and apoptosis. However, its clinical 
application is severely limited by drawbacks such as structural instability, 
poor water solubility, and low bioavailability. Currently, formulation 
techniques such as dripping pills, micropills, inclusion complexes, and 
liposomes are being used to improve its stability and water solubility, thereby 
enhancing its therapeutic efficacy. This article summarized the effects, 
mechanisms of action, and pharmacokinetics of ligustilide monomers and 
preparations in the treatment of locomotor system diseases in China and abroad 
in recent years, aiming to provide reference and guidance for further 
development and application of ligustilide in this field.

Amyloid-targeting therapy has recently become widely available in the United 
States for the treatment of patients with symptomatic mild Alzheimer disease 
(AD). At present, there are no biomarkers that have been clinically validated to 
assess treatment response in routine clinical practice; longitudinal amyloid PET 
could play a role but is not cost-effective. This report presents a case series 
of 6 patients with AD, whose amyloid positivity was confirmed by PET or CSF 
biomarkers, who underwent baseline and longitudinal arterial spin-labeling MR 
imaging (ASL-MR) as part of Food and Drug Administration-mandated, clinical 
standard-of-care, noncontrast MR monitoring to assess for amyloid-related 
imaging abnormalities (ARIA). We and others have previously reported that ASL-MR 
can screen for neurodegenerative disease as a proxy for FDG-PET and can be 
easily added on as a cost-effective, repeatable method to monitor post therapy 
changes. This series highlights varied CBF changes in response to lecanemab 
therapy. For instance, Cases 1, 3, and 5 showed increased CBF after multiple 
infusions, with subjective cognitive improvement in Case 1 and improved MoCA 
scores in Case 3. Case 2 showed improved CBF initially before the fifth 
infusion, but this returned to baseline in the subsequent study, with no 
cognitive improvement over the course of therapy. Cases 4 and 6 have 
demonstrated no substantial changes in regional CBF thus far on therapy, with 
cognitive decline in Case 4. This case series underscores the potential utility 
of ASL-MR as an adjunct sequence to current imaging protocols to monitor 
treatment response to antiamyloid therapy.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and Huntington disease, pose serious threats to human health, leading to 
substantial economic burdens on society and families. Despite extensive 
research, the underlying mechanisms driving these diseases remain incompletely 
understood, impeding effective diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, growing 
evidence has highlighted the crucial role of oxidative stress in the 
pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is still a 
lack of comprehensive reviews that systematically summarize the impact of 
mitochondrial oxidative stress on neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims 
to address this gap by summarizing the molecular mechanisms by which 
mitochondrial oxidative stress promotes the initiation and progression of 
neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, it discusses the potential of 
antioxidant-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these diseases. By 
shedding light on the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in 
neurodegenerative diseases, this review not only serves as a valuable reference 
for further research on the disease mechanisms, but also offers novel 
perspectives for the treatment of these disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most commonly occurring brain disorder, 
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, subsequently 
leading to neurocognitive decline. 3-Amino-1-propanesulfonic acid (TPS) and its 
prodrug, currently under clinical trial III, serve as promising therapeutic 
agents targeting Aβ pathology by specifically preventing monomer-to-oligomer 
formation. Inspired by the potency of TPS prodrug, we hypothesized that 
conjugating TPS with human serum albumin (HSA) could enhance brain delivery and 
synergistically inhibit Aβ aggregation in mild to moderate AD. Thus, we prepared 
and extensively characterized HSA-TPS (h-TPS) conjugate using an eco-friendly 
coupling method. In vitro studies on Aβ aggregation kinetics and AFM imaging 
revealed significant prevention of Aβ aggregation. Additionally, h-TPS 
significantly reduced Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and H2O2-mediated reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) stress in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, h-TPS administration improved 
blood-brain barrier permeability and cellular uptake into neuronal cells as well 
as showed in vivo uptake inside the brain within 1 h. In vivo studies using an 
Aβ1-42-induced acute AD rat model exhibited a dose-dependent significant 
reduction in hippocampal Aβ levels and restoration of declined spatial learning 
and memory with h-TPS treatment. Overall, findings suggest that h-TPS conjugate 
might be a promising neuroprotective agent for preventing Aβ aggregation in mild 
to moderate AD.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder in which dysregulated 
neuroimmune crosstalk and inflammatory relay via the gut-blood-brain axis have 
been implicated in PD pathogenesis. Although alterations in circulating 
inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been associated 
with PD, no biomarkers have been identified that predict clinical progression or 
disease outcome. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, which involves perturbation 
of the underlying immune system, is an early and often-overlooked symptom that 
affects up to 80 % of individuals living with PD. Interestingly, 50-70 % of 
individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a GI condition that has been 
epidemiologically linked to PD, display chronic illness-induced anemia - which 
drives toxic accumulation of iron in the gut. Ferroptotic (or iron loaded) cells 
have small and dysmorphic mitochondria-suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction 
is a consequence of iron accumulation. In pro-inflammatory environments, iron 
accumulates in immune cells, suggesting a possible connection and/or synergy 
between iron dysregulation and immune cell dysfunction. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) recapitulate certain PD-associated neuropathological 
and inflammatory signatures and can act as communicating messengers in the 
gut-brain axis. Additionally, this communication can be modulated by several 
environmental factors; specifically, our data further support existing 
literature demonstrating a role for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) in modulating immune transcriptional states in inflamed individuals. A 
mechanism linking chronic gut inflammation to iron dysregulation and 
mitochondrial function within peripheral immune cells has yet to be identified 
in conferring risk for PD. To that end, we isolated PBMCs and simultaneously 
evaluated their directed transcriptome and bioenergetic status, to investigate 
if iron dysregulation and mitochondrial sensitization are linked in individuals 
living with PD or IBD because of chronic underlying remittent immune activation. 
We have identified shared features of peripheral inflammation and 
immunometabolism in individuals living with IBD or PD that may contribute to the 
epidemiological association reported between IBD and risk for PD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
globally, with no effective treatment available yet. A crucial pathological 
hallmark of AD is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which is 
deteriorated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neuroinflammation in AD 
progression. Thus, alleviation of ROS and inflammation has become a potential 
therapeutic strategy in many studies. Herein, we reported ultrasmall 
coordination polymer nanoparticles formed by ferric ions and gallic acid (Fe-GA 
CPNs), which owned antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties for AD 
therapeutics. The facilely prepared Fe-GA CPNs exhibited remarkable superoxide 
dismutase-like, peroxidase-like enzyme activity, and ROS eliminating ability 
with great water solubility, compared with gallic acid. We demonstrated that 
Fe-GA CPNs effectively relieved oxidative stress, ameliorated inflammation by 
modulating microglial polarization towards anti-inflammation phenotype, and 
reduced hyperphosphorylated tau protein levels. Furthermore, Fe-GA CPNs 
treatment significantly improved cognitive function in tauopathy-induced AD 
rats, and achieved a neuroprotective effect against AD pathology. This study 
highlights the potential of coordination polymer nanoparticles as promising 
therapeutic candidates for AD and other tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Testosterone, an essential sex steroid hormone, influences brain health by 
impacting neurophysiology and neuropathology throughout the lifespan in both 
genders. However, human research in this area is limited, particularly in women. 
This study examines the associations between testosterone levels, gray matter 
volume (GMV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in midlife individuals at risk for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), according to sex and menopausal status. A cohort of 
294 cognitively normal midlife participants, 83% female, ages 35-65 years, with 
an AD family history and/or Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE-4) genotype, 
underwent volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to measure GMV and 
MR-Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) for measurement of CBF. We used voxel-based 
analysis and volumes of interest to test for associations between testosterone 
(both total and free testosterone) and brain imaging outcomes, stratified by sex 
and menopausal status. Higher total and free testosterone levels were associated 
with larger GMV in men, with peak effects in frontal and temporal regions. 
Conversely, in women, higher testosterone levels correlated with higher CBF, 
with peak effects in frontal and limbic regions, subcortical areas and 
hypothalamus. Among women, associations between testosterone and GMV were 
observed at the premenopausal and perimenopausal stages, but not postmenopause, 
whereas associations of testosterone with CBF were significant starting at the 
perimenopausal stage and were more pronounced among hormone therapy non-users. 
Results were independent of age, APOE-4 status, midlife health indicators, and 
sex hormone-binding globulin levels. These findings indicate sex-specific 
neurophysiological effects of testosterone in AD-vulnerable regions in midlife 
individuals at risk for AD, with variations observed across sex and menopausal 
status. This underscores the need for further research focusing on the 
neuroprotective potential of testosterone in both sexes.

People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a greater risk of developing 
neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, in later life. Exogenous 
ketone supplements containing the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) may be a 
strategy to protect the brain as β-OHB can support cerebral metabolism and 
promote neuronal plasticity via expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF). Parallel human (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04194450, ClinicalTrials.gov ID 
NCT05155410) and rodent trials were conducted to characterize the effect of 
acute and short-term exogenous ketone supplementation on indices of brain 
health. First, we aimed to investigate the effect of acute and short-term 
supplementation of exogenous ketone monoester on circulating BDNF and cognition 
in adults with T2D. There were no effects of ketone supplementation on plasma 
BDNF or cognition. Second, we aimed to investigate the mechanistic effects of 
acute and chronic β-OHB supplementation on cortical BDNF content and recognition 
memory in C57BL/6J mice with and without insulin resistance. Acutely, β-OHB did 
not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Similarly, chronic β-OHB 
supplementation did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Collectively, 
our data demonstrates that ketone supplementation does not elevate BDNF content 
in humans or mice. Furthermore, our data does not support the involvement of 
BDNF in the potential cognitive benefits of β-OHB supplementation.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY Ketone supplementation does not alter circulating BDNF levels or 
cognition in humans with T2D. Acute and chronic ketone supplementation in 
C57BL/6J mice did not change BDNF protein content or improve recognition memory. 
Ketone supplementation in C57BL/6J mice positively modulated β-site amyloid 
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity, providing a potential 
future therapeutic strategy.

BACKGROUND: Digital biomarkers are increasingly used in clinical decision 
support for various health conditions. Speech features as digital biomarkers can 
offer insights into underlying physiological processes due to the complexity of 
speech production. This process involves respiration, phonation, articulation, 
and resonance, all of which rely on specific motor systems for the preparation 
and execution of speech. Deficits in any of these systems can cause changes in 
speech signal patterns. Increasing efforts are being made to develop 
speech-based clinical decision support systems.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic scoping review investigated the technological 
revolution and recent digital clinical speech signal analysis trends to 
understand the key concepts and research processes from clinical and technical 
perspectives.
METHODS: A systematic scoping review was undertaken in 6 databases guided by a 
set of research questions. Articles that focused on speech signal analysis for 
clinical decision-making were identified, and the included studies were analyzed 
quantitatively. A narrower scope of studies investigating neurological diseases 
were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 389 articles met the initial eligibility criteria, of which 
72 (18.5%) that focused on neurological diseases were included in the 
qualitative analysis. In the included studies, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer 
disease, and cognitive disorders were the most frequently investigated 
conditions. The literature explored the potential of speech feature analysis in 
diagnosis, differentiating between, assessing the severity and monitoring the 
treatment of neurological conditions. The common speech tasks used were 
sustained phonations, diadochokinetic tasks, reading tasks, activity-based 
tasks, picture descriptions, and prompted speech tasks. From these tasks, 
conventional speech features (such as fundamental frequency, jitter, and 
shimmer), advanced digital signal processing-based speech features (such as 
wavelet transformation-based features), and spectrograms in the form of audio 
images were analyzed. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches 
were used to build predictive models, whereas statistical analysis assessed 
variable relationships and reliability of speech features. Model evaluations 
primarily focused on analytical validations. A significant research gap was 
identified: the need for a structured research process to guide studies toward 
potential technological intervention in clinical settings. To address this, a 
research framework was proposed that adapts a design science research 
methodology to guide research studies systematically.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight how data science techniques can enhance 
speech signal analysis to support clinical decision-making. By combining 
knowledge from clinical practice, speech science, and data science within a 
structured research framework, future research may achieve greater clinical 
relevance.

IMPORTANCE: Although 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) is a well-established cross-sectional biomarker of brain metabolism in 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the longitudinal change in FDG-PET has not been 
characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate longitudinal FDG-PET in prodromal DLB and DLB, 
including a subsample with autopsy data, and report estimated sample sizes for a 
hypothetical clinical trial in DLB.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal case-control study with mean 
(SD) follow-up of 3.8 (2.3) years. Cases were recruited consecutively between 
2007 and 2022 at a referral center and among the population. Patients with 
probable DLB or mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) were 
included. Individuals without cognitive impairment were included from a 
population-based cohort balanced on age and sex for comparison. All participants 
completed at least 1 follow-up assessment by design.
EXPOSURE: Patients with MCI-LB and DLB.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rate of change in FDG-PET was assessed as 
standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr). Clinical progression was assessed with 
the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with probable DLB, 37 patients with MCI-LB, and 
100 individuals without cognitive impairment were included. The mean (SD) age of 
the DLB and MCI-LB groups combined (n = 72) was 69.6 (8.2) years; 66 patients 
(92%) were men and 6 (8%) were women. At follow-up, 18 participants (49%) with 
MCI-LB had progressed to probable DLB. Patients with MCI-LB had a faster decline 
in FDG-SUVr, compared with that of participants without cognitive impairment, in 
the posterior cingulate, occipital, parietal, temporal, and lateral frontal 
cortices. The same regions showed greater metabolic decline in patients with DLB 
than in participants without cognitive impairment, with the addition of 
anterior-middle cingulate, insula, and medial frontal orbital cortices. Rates of 
change in FDG-PET in these brain regions were combined into a region of interest 
(ROI) labeled longitudinal FDG-PET LB meta-ROI. The rate of change in FDG-SUVr 
in the meta-ROI correlated with the rate of change in CDR-SB, and sample size 
estimates were reported for potential clinical trials in DLB. Findings were 
confirmed in the subsample with neuropathologic confirmation (n = 20).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that brain hypometabolism begins to 
evolve during the prodromal stages of DLB with changes paralleling symptomatic 
progression. These data may inform clinical practice and trials planning to use 
FDG-PET for biologic staging, monitoring disease progression, and potentially 
assessing treatment response.

Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to continue diagnosis and 
treatment processes, in addition to scientific research, led to a rapid shift 
towards direct-to-home tele-neuropsychology administrations, the reliability and 
validity of which had not been clearly established then. This study, therefore, 
aimed to examine the reliability of direct-to-home tele-neuropsychological 
assessment (TNP). Method: The sample included 105 cognitively healthy 
individuals aged between 50-83 years, and 47 patients diagnosed with 
neurocognitive disorders (mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer's 
type dementia). All participants underwent both face-to-face and 
teleneuropsychological assessments in a counterbalanced order. Results: The 
results revealed that performances across measures of attention, working memory, 
verbal fluency, verbal and visual memory, and visual perception were comparable 
across assessment modalities. Intraclass correlation coefficients of the tests 
ranged from .54 to .92. Conclusions: The findings of the study provide support 
for direct-to-home teleneuropsychological assessment among patients with 
neurocognitive disorders. Neuropsychological tests relying on verbal 
administration and independent of motor performance may represent a reliable 
alternative for this patient group when administered in settings where external 
distractions or technological limitations are controlled. For cognitively 
healthy individuals, on the other hand, the reliability of the TNP application 
is more questionable for memory and some executive function tests and therefore 
needs further exploration.

BACKGROUND: Wider step width and lower step-to-step variability are linked to 
improved gait stability and reduced fall risk. It is unclear if patients with 
spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) can learn to adjust these aspects of gait to reduce 
fall risk.
OBJECTIVES: The aims were to examine the possibility of using wearable step 
width haptic biofeedback to enhance gait stability and reduce fall risk in 
individuals with SCA.
METHODS: Thirteen people with SCA type 3 performed step width training (single 
session) using real-time feedback.
RESULTS: Step width increased post-training (19.3 cm, interquartile range [IQR] 
16.3-20.2 cm) and at retention (16.6 cm, IQR 16.2-21.1 cm), compared to baseline 
(11.0 cm, IQR 5.2-15.2 cm; P < 0.001). Step width variability decreased during 
post-training (19.7%, IQR 17.4%-26.2%) and at retention (22.3%, IQR 
18.6%-30.2%), compared to baseline (44.5%, IQR 28.5%-71.2%; P < 0.001). 
Crossover steps, another mark of instability, decreased after training 
(P < 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: These pilot results suggest that patients with SCA can use a novel, 
wearable biofeedback system to improve their gait stability. © 2025

It is hypothesised that peripheral immune states responding to regional 
environmental triggers contribute to central neurodegeneration. Region-specific 
genetic selection pressures require this hypothesis to be assessed in an 
ancestry specific manner. Here we utilise genome-wide association studies and 
expression quantitative trait loci from African, East Asian and European 
ancestries to show that genes causing neurodegeneration are preferentially 
expressed in innate rather than adaptive immune cells, and that expression of 
these genes mediates the risk of neurodegenerative disease in monocytes in an 
ancestry-specific manner.

Neurons located in layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the primary site 
of pathological tau accumulation and neurodegeneration at preclinical stages of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exploring the alterations that underlie the early 
degeneration of these cells is essential to develop therapies that curb the 
disease before symptom onset. Here we performed cell-type specific profiling of 
human EC at the onset of AD neuropathology. We identify an early response to 
amyloid pathology by microglia and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, we provide the 
first insight into neuronal alterations that coincide with incipient tau 
pathology: the signaling pathway for Reelin, recently shown to be a major AD 
resilience gene is dysregulated in ECII neurons, while the secreted synaptic 
organizer molecules NPTX2 and CBLN4, emerging AD biomarkers, are downregulated 
in surrounding neurons. By uncovering the complex multicellular landscape of EC 
at these early AD stages, this study paves the way for detailed characterization 
of the mechanisms governing NFT formation and opens long-needed novel 
therapeutic avenues.

Microglia modulate their cell state in response to various stimuli. Changes to 
cellular lipids often accompany shifts in microglial cell state, but the 
functional significance of these metabolic changes remains poorly understood. In 
human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, we observed that both 
extrinsic activation (by lipopolysaccharide treatment) and intrinsic triggers 
(the Alzheimer's disease-associated APOE4 genotype) result in accumulation of 
triglyceride-rich lipid droplets. We demonstrate that lipid droplet accumulation 
is not simply concomitant with changes in cell state but rather necessary for 
microglial activation. We discovered that both triglyceride biosynthesis and 
catabolism are needed for the transcription and secretion of proinflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines in response to extrinsic stimuli. Additionally, we 
reveal that triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are necessary for the 
activation-associated phagocytosis of multiple substrates including the 
disease-associated amyloid-beta peptide. In microglia harboring the Alzheimer's 
disease risk APOE4 genotype, triglyceride-rich lipid droplets accumulate even in 
the absence of any external stimuli. Inhibiting triglyceride biosynthesis in 
APOE4 microglia not only modifies the transcription of immune response genes but 
also attenuates disease-associated transcriptional states. This work establishes 
that triglyceride metabolism is necessary for microglia to respond to extrinsic 
activation. In APOE4 microglia, this metabolic process modulates both immune 
signaling and a disease-associated transcriptional state. Importantly, our work 
identifies metabolic pathways that can be used to tune microglial 
immunometabolism in APOE4- associated disease.

The biological mechanisms underlying women's increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
prevalence remain undefined. Previous case/control studies have identified 
sex-biased molecular pathways, but sex-specific relationships between gene 
expression and AD endophenotypes, particularly sex chromosomes, are 
underexplored. With bulk transcriptomic data across 3 brain regions from 767 
decedents, we investigated sex-specific associations between gene expression and 
post-mortem β-amyloid and tau as well as antemortem longitudinal cognition. Of 
23,118 significant gene associations, 10% were significant in one sex and not 
the other (sex-specific). Most sex-specific gene associations were identified in 
females (73%) and associated with tau tangles and longitudinal cognition (90%). 
Four X-linked genes, MCF2, HDAC8, FTX, and SLC10A3, demonstrated significant sex 
differences in their associations with AD endophenotypes (i.e., significant sex 
x gene interaction). Our results also uncovered sex-specific biological 
pathways, including a female-specific role of neuroinflammation and neuronal 
development, reinforcing the potential for sex-aware analyses to enhance 
precision medicine approaches in AD.

INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, 
and epilepsy, pose significant diagnostic and treatment challenges due to their 
complexity and the gradual degeneration of central nervous system structures. 
This study introduces a deep learning framework designed to automate 
neuro-diagnostics, addressing the limitations of current manual interpretation 
methods, which are often time-consuming and prone to variability.
METHODS: We propose a specialized deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) 
framework aimed at detecting and classifying neurological anomalies in MRI data. 
Our approach incorporates key preprocessing techniques, such as reducing noise 
and normalizing image intensity in MRI scans, alongside an optimized model 
architecture. The model employs Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation 
functions, the Adam optimizer, and a random search strategy to fine-tune 
hyper-parameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of neurons in 
fully connected layers. To ensure reliability and broad applicability, 
cross-fold validation was used.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our DCNN achieved a remarkable classification accuracy 
of 98.44%, surpassing well-known models such as ResNet-50 and AlexNet when 
evaluated on a comprehensive MRI dataset. Moreover, performance metrics such as 
precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated separately, confirming the 
robustness and efficiency of our model across various evaluation criteria. 
Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and t-tests, further validated the 
significance of the performance improvements observed with our proposed method. 
This model represents an important step toward creating a fully automated system 
for diagnosing and planning treatment for neurological diseases. The high 
accuracy of our framework highlights its potential to improve diagnostic 
workflows by enabling precise detection, tracking disease progression, and 
supporting personalized treatment strategies. While the results are promising, 
further research is necessary to assess how the model performs across different 
clinical scenarios. Future studies could focus on integrating additional data 
types, such as longitudinal imaging and multimodal techniques, to further 
enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility. These findings mark a 
significant advancement in applying deep learning to neuro-diagnostics, with 
promising implications for improving patient outcomes and clinical practices.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed a strong association between the e2 
allele of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE2) gene and lipid metabolites. In addition, 
APOE2 carriers appear to be protected from cognitive decline and Alzheimer's 
disease. This correlation supports the hypothesis that lipids may mediate the 
protective effect of APOE2 on cognitive function, thereby providing potential 
targets for therapeutic intervention.
METHODS: We conducted a causal mediation analysis to estimate both the direct 
effect of APOE2 and its indirect effect through 19 lipid species on cognitive 
function, using metrics from the digital Clock Drawing Test (CDT) in 1291 Long 
Life Family Study (LLFS) participants. The CDT metrics included think-time, 
ink-time, and their sum as total-time to complete the test.
RESULTS: Compared to carriers of the common APOE3, APOE2 carriers completed the 
CDT significantly faster. Two lipids showed protective mediation when elevated 
in the blood, resulting in shorter CDT think-time (CE 18:3), ink-time (TG 56:5), 
and total completion time (CE 18:3 and TG 56:5). Elevated TG 56:4, in contrast, 
showed deleterious mediation resulting in increased ink-time. The combined 
indirect effect through all lipids significantly mediated 23.1% of the total 
effect of APOE2 on total-time, reducing it by 0.92s (95% CI: 0.17, 2.00). 
Additionally, the sum of total indirect effect from all lipids also mediated 
27.3% of the total effect on think-time, reducing it by 0.75s, and 13.6% of the 
total effect on ink-time, reducing it by 0.17s, though these reductions were 
statistically insignificant. Sensitivity analysis yielded consistent results of 
the combined indirect effects and total effects and identified additional 
significant lipid pathways (CE 22:6, TG 51:3, and TG 54:2).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the combined indirect effect through all lipids could 
mediate 10%-27% of the total direct effect of APOE2 on CDT times. We identified 
both protective and deleterious lipids, providing insights for new therapeutics 
targeting those lipids to modulate the protective effects of APOE2 on cognition.

A wide number of natural molecules demonstrated neuroprotective effects on 
synaptic plasticity defects induced by amyloid-β (Aβ) in ex vivo and in vivo 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) models, suggesting a possible use in the treatment of 
this neurodegenerative disorder. However, several compounds, administered 
parenterally and orally, are unable to reach the brain due to the presence of 
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which prevents the passage of external substances, 
such as proteins, peptides, or phytocompounds, representing a limit to the 
development of treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. The 
combination of nano vesicular systems, as colloidal systems, and nose to brain 
(NtB) delivery depicts a new nanotechnological strategy to overtake this limit 
and to develop new treatment approaches for brain diseases, including the use of 
natural molecules in combination therapy for AD. Herein, we will provide an 
updated overview, examining the literature of the last 20 years and using 
specific keywords that provide evidence on natural products with the ability to 
restore synaptic plasticity alterations in AD models, and the possible 
application using safe and non-invasive strategies focusing on nano vesicular 
systems for NtB delivery.

Hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation is seen in the noradrenergic locus 
coeruleus from the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease onwards and has been 
associated with symptoms of agitation. It is hypothesized that compensatory 
locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system overactivity and impaired emotion 
regulation could underlie agitation propensity, but to our knowledge this has 
not previously been investigated. A better understanding of the neurobiological 
underpinnings of agitation would help the development of targeted prevention and 
treatment strategies. Using a sample of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment and probable mild Alzheimer's disease dementia from the German Center 
for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and 
Dementia (DELCODE) study cohort (N = 309, aged 67-96 years, 51% female), we 
assessed cross-sectional relationships between a latent factor representing the 
functional integrity of an affect-related executive regulation network and 
agitation point prevalence and severity scores. In a subsample of individuals 
with locus coeruleus MRI imaging data (N = 37, aged 68-93 years, 49% female), we 
also investigated preliminary associations between locus coeruleus MRI contrast 
ratios (a measure of structural integrity, whole or divided into rostral, 
middle, and caudal thirds) and individual affect-related regulation network 
factor scores and agitation measures. Regression models controlled for effects 
of age and clinical disease severity and, for models including resting-state 
functional MRI connectivity variables, grey matter volume and education years. 
Agitation point prevalence showed a positive relationship with a latent factor 
representing the functional integrity (and a negative relationship with a 
corresponding structural measure) of the affect-related executive regulation 
network. Locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios were positively associated with 
agitation severity (but only for the rostral third, in N = 13) and negatively 
associated with the functional affect-related executive regulation latent factor 
scores. Resting-state functional connectivity between a medial prefrontal cortex 
region and the left amygdala was related to locus coeruleus MRI contrast ratios. 
These findings implicate the involvement of locus coeruleus integrity and 
emotion dysregulation in agitation in Alzheimer's disease and support the 
presence of potential compensatory processes. At the neural level, there may be 
a dissociation between mechanisms underlying agitation risk per se and symptom 
severity. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings, 
incorporating longitudinal designs, measures of autonomic function and 
non-linear modelling approaches to explore potential causal and 
context-dependent relationships across Alzheimer's disease stages.

BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
are crucial for effective treatment and management. Traditional diagnostic 
models, largely based on binary classification systems, fail to adequately 
capture the complexities and variations across different stages and subtypes of 
AD, limiting their clinical utility.
METHODS: We developed a deep learning model integrating a dot-product attention 
mechanism and an innovative labeling system to enhance the diagnosis and 
classification of AD subtypes and severity levels. This model processed various 
clinical and demographic data, emphasizing the most relevant features for AD 
diagnosis. The approach emphasized precision in identifying disease subtypes and 
predicting their severity through advanced computational techniques that mimic 
expert clinical decision-making.
RESULTS: Comparative tests against a baseline fully connected neural network 
demonstrated that our proposed model significantly improved diagnostic accuracy. 
Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.1% for identifying AD subtypes, compared to 
72.9% by the baseline. In severity prediction, our model reached an accuracy of 
83.3%, outperforming the baseline (73.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of a dot-product attention mechanism and a 
tailored labeling system in our model significantly enhances the accuracy of 
diagnosing and classifying AD. This improvement highlights the potential of the 
model to support personalized treatment strategies and advance precision 
medicine in neurodegenerative diseases.

Human microbiota-associated murine models, using fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) from human donors, help explore the microbiome's role in 
diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examines how gut bacteria 
from donors with protective factors against AD influence behavior and brain 
pathology in an AD mouse model. Female 3xTgAD mice received weekly FMT for 
2 months from (i) an 80-year-old AD patient (AD-FMT), (ii) a cognitively healthy 
73-year-old with the protective APOEe2 allele (APOEe2-FMT), (iii) a 22-year-old 
healthy donor (Young-FMT), and (iv) untreated mice (Mice-FMT). Behavioral 
assessments included novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze, open-field, and 
elevated plus maze tests; brain pathology (amyloid and tau), neuroinflammation 
(in situ autoradiography of the 18 kDa translocator protein in the hippocampus); 
and gut microbiota were analyzed. APOEe2-FMT improved short-term memory in the 
NOR test compared to AD-FMT, without significant changes in other behavioral 
tests. This was associated with increased neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, 
but no effect was detected on brain amyloidosis and tauopathy. Specific genera, 
such as Parabacteroides and Prevotellaceae_UGC001, were enriched in the 
APOEe2-FMT group and associated with neuroinflammation, while genera like 
Desulfovibrio were reduced and linked to decreased neuroinflammation. Gut 
microbiota from a donor with a protective factor against AD improved short-term 
memory and induced neuroinflammation in regions strategic to AD. The association 
of several genera with neuroinflammation in the APOEe2-FMT group suggests a 
collegial effect of the transplanted microbiome rather than a single-microbe 
driver effect. These data support an association between gut bacteria, glial 
cell activation, and cognitive function in AD.

BACKGROUND: Lecanemab, a novel monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-β, has 
shown promise in treating Alzheimer's disease. Comprehensive post-marketing 
safety data analysis is crucial to understand its real-world risk profile.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety profile of lecanemab using 
data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), with a focus on 
nervous system disorders and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities.
METHODS: We conducted a disproportionality analysis using the FAERS database to 
evaluate the safety signals associated with lecanemab. Reporting odds ratio 
(ROR), proportional reporting ratio, empirical Bayesian geometric mean, and 
information component were calculated at both system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) levels. Additionally, we performed a time-to-onset analysis 
using Weibull shape parameter estimation.
RESULTS: Analysis at the SOC level revealed significant signals for nervous 
system disorders (ROR: 7.32, 95% CI: 6.69-8.00). At the PT level, strong signals 
were observed for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, particularly those 
associated with microhemorrhages and oedema (ROR: 4122.81 and 3922.78, 
respectively). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (200 
cases), followed by chills (107 cases) and fatigue (97 cases). Time-to-onset 
analysis showed a median time of 33 days (range: 1-1283) for all adverse events, 
with neurological events occurring slightly later (median: 42 days, range: 
1-1260).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight a distinct safety profile for lecanemab, 
with a predominant impact on the nervous system and a notable association with 
imaging abnormalities. These results underscore the importance of vigilant 
monitoring and further research to optimize the risk-benefit profile of 
lecanemab in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms 
of dementia is of limited benefit. The addition of non-pharmacological 
interventions is often essential for optimal symptom control. Music is a viable 
way to help patients communicate and improve their quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to find the most effective way to use music in a busy 
dementia ward.
METHODS: 17 inpatients (aged 63-93 years) with a clinical diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease and dementia took part over five weeks. Music lyrics 
presented via free-field speakers were individualized to personal preferences. 
Instruments (e.g., maracas) were used in some group sessions. We used the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Music in Dementia 
Assessment Scales (MiDAS) to evaluate patients' behavior before and after 
musical intervention.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in mean NPI-Q scores before and 
after the music intervention. Specifically, Delusion, Motor Disturbances, and 
Agitation scores were significantly reduced after music intervention. This was 
accompanied by significant improvements in Interest, Response, and Enjoyment of 
MiDAS items during specific intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical professionals can successfully deliver music-based 
intervention to inpatients with advanced dementia to help manage their 
behavioral symptoms in the short term. Music-based interventions' use for 
inpatient wards must be further investigated as an economical and personalized 
non-pharmacological therapeutic tool for patients with dementia.

BACKGROUND: With increasing age, dementia is a common disease in the elderly 
population，especially Alzheimer's disease. Owing to the nature of the disease, 
the function of patients deteriorates, which places a heavy burden on the 
country and family. Home-based training programs have been shown to improve 
cognitive function in patients with dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects and methods of home-based interventions on the 
cognitive performance of patients with dementia.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the basis of 
the PRISMA statement. This protocol was registered in advance at PROSPERO 
(CRD42021277269). Six English electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, 
the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and OTseeker, were searched and 
updated to January 31, 2024. Two researchers independently completed the 
literature retrieval and data extraction. RevMan 5.3 software was used to 
analyze the data. The standardized mean difference and the 95% confidence 
interval were used for statistical analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed by 
assessment tools, intervention duration and intervention methods.
RESULTS: Twenty randomized controlled trials with 3543 participants were 
included in the qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were included in the 
meta-analysis. Compared with the control intervention, the home-based 
intervention significantly improved cognitive performance (SMD = 0.45; 95% 
CI = [0.17, 0.74]; p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to high evidence shows that home-based interventions 
significantly improve the cognitive performance of patients with dementia, 
especially their comprehensive cognitive function.

The advancement of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), along with the approval of three amyloid-targeting therapies in the US and 
several other countries, represents a significant development in the treatment 
landscape, offering new hope for addressing this once untreatable chronic 
progressive disease. However, significant challenges persist that could impede 
the successful integration of this class of drugs into clinical practice. These 
challenges include determining patient eligibility, appropriate use of 
diagnostic tools and genetic testing in patient care pathways, effective 
detection and monitoring of side effects, and improving the healthcare system's 
readiness by engaging both primary care and dementia specialists. Additionally, 
there are logistical concerns related to infrastructure, as well as 
cost-effectiveness and reimbursement issues. This article brings together 
insights from a diverse group of international researchers and dementia experts 
and outlines the potential challenges and opportunities, urging all stakeholders 
to prepare for the introduction of DMTs. We emphasize the need to develop 
appropriate use criteria, including patient characteristics, specifically for 
the European healthcare system, to ensure that treatments are administered to 
the most suitable patients. It is crucial to improve the skills and knowledge of 
physicians to accurately interpret biomarker results, share decision-making with 
patients, recognize treatment-related side effects, and monitor long-term 
treatment. We advocate for investment in patient registries and unbiased 
follow-up studies to better understand treatment effectiveness, evaluate 
treatment-related side effects, and optimize long-term treatment. Utilizing 
amyloid-targeting therapies as a starting point for combination therapies should 
also be a priority.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical diagnosis representing 
early symptom changes with preserved functional independence. There are multiple 
potential etiologies of MCI. While often presumed to be related to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), other neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative causes are 
common. Wider availability of relatively non-invasive plasma AD biomarkers, such 
as p-tau217, can provide invaluable insights into MCI clinico-pathology and the 
associated implications for symptom etiology, prognosis (e.g., risk for 
progression to dementia), and treatment options.
OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this study was to evaluate differences between 
individuals with MCI with and without plasma p-tau217 biomarker evidence of AD 
(MCIAD+ and MCIAD-) as well as a control group of clinically normal older adults 
with negative AD biomarkers (CNAD-). We evaluated group differences in 
demographics, recruitment, clinical scales, fluid biomarkers, and brain imaging. 
We further probed these factors as independent contributors to symptoms among 
MCIAD- participants, for whom symptom etiology is most poorly understood. 
Lastly, in a subset of participants followed longitudinally, we investigated how 
these factors related to odds of clinical progression to dementia.
DESIGN: We conducted an observational cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical 
research study. Study groups were compared cross-sectionally on demographics, 
recruitment, clinical measures, and biomarkers (chi square analyses, analyses of 
covariance). Contributors to functional changes were evaluated with multiple 
linear regression. Factors associated with the odds of progression from MCI to 
dementia longitudinally were evaluated with binary logistic regression.
SETTING: 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.
PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analyses included 378 older adults classified as 
CNAD- (N = 76, age 66.1 ± 7.2, 63.2% female, 23.7% non-Hispanic/White), MCIAD- 
(N = 198, age 68.9 ± 7.9, 51.5% female, 29.3% non-Hispanic/White), or MCIAD+ (N 
= 104, age 73.9 ± 7.4, 52.9% female, 49.0% non-Hispanic/White). Longitudinal 
analyses focused on 207 participants with MCI (68.5% of cross-sectional MCI 
sample) followed for an average of 3 years.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographics (age, sex, years of education, self-identified race 
and ethnicity, primary spoken language), National Alzheimer's Coordinating 
Center-defined clinical phenotypes (Clinically Normal, Impaired - Not MCI, 
Amnestic MCI, Nonamnestic MCI, Dementia), recruitment source (clinic-based 
versus community-based), genetics (APOE genotype), functional evaluation 
(Clinical Dementia Rating scale), global cognition (Mini Mental State Exam), 
vascular history (Vascular Burden Score), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q Total 
score), plasma biomarkers (ALZPath p-tau217, Quanterix Simoa-based GFAP and 
NfL), and brain imaging (grey matter volume in select AD-relevant regions of 
interest, global white matter hyperintensity volume).
RESULTS: Among those with MCI, 104 (34.4%) had plasma biomarker evidence of AD. 
MCIAD+ participants were more frequently recruited from clinic-based settings 
than MCIAD- (74.8% vs. 47.5%, p<.001). Over half (51.5%) of MCIAD+ carried at 
least one APOE e4 allele compared to 26.6% of MCIAD- and 29.4% of CNAD- 
(p<.001). Both MCIAD+ (p<.001, Cohen's d = 0.93) and MCIAD- (p<.001, d = 0.75) 
reported more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms than CNAD. MCIAD+ had higher 
plasma GFAP and NfL than both MCIAD- (GFAP: p<.001, d = 0.88, NfL: p<.001, d = 
0.86) and CNAD- (GFAP: p<.001, d = 0.80; NfL: p<.001, d = 0.89). For the AD 
signature region of interest, MCIAD+ had lower volume than both CNAD- (p<.001, d 
= 0.78) and MCIAD- (p=.018, d = 0.39). For the hippocampus, both MCIAD+ (p<.001, 
d = 0.87) and MCIAD- (p<.001, d = 0.64) had lower volume than CNAD-. 
Longitudinally, older age (OR=1.14 [1.06-1.22], p<.001), higher levels of 
p-tau217 (OR=10.37 [3.00-35.02], p<.001) and higher neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(OR=1.19 [1.02-1.39], p=.023) were associated with higher odds of progression to 
dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: MCI is etiologically heterogeneous. The presence of Alzheimer's 
pathology defined by elevated plasma p-tau217 in individuals with MCI 
significantly worsens prognosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may contribute to 
cognitive complaints and risk for progressive decline irrespective of AD 
pathology. Plasma p-tau217 can inform our understanding of base rates of 
different MCI phenotypes on a larger scale. As with other AD biomarkers, 
frequency of elevated plasma p-tau217 and odds of progression to dementia 
requires careful consideration of recruitment source (clinic- vs. 
community-based), especially across ethno-racially diverse older adults. Ongoing 
integration of emerging neurodegenerative disease biomarkers with detailed 
clinical evaluations will continue to improve treatment specificity and 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Investigators conducting clinical trials have an ethical, 
scientific, and regulatory obligation to protect the safety of trial 
participants. Traditionally, safety monitoring includes manual review and coding 
of adverse event data by expert clinicians.
OBJECTIVES: Our study explores the use of natural language processing (NLP) and 
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to streamline and standardize clinician 
coding of adverse event data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials.
DESIGN: Our quantitative retrospective study aimed to develop a gold standard AD 
adverse event data set, evaluate the predictive performance of NLP-based models 
to classify adverse events, and determine whether automated coding is more 
efficient, accurate, reliable, and consistent than clinician coding.
SETTING: Our study was conducted at the University of Southern California's 
Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI). ATRI serves as the clinical 
and data coordinating center for the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium 
(ACTC).
PARTICIPANTS: We collected demographic and adverse event data from eight 
completed clinical trials in participants (n=1920) with symptomatic AD conducted 
between 2005 and 2020.
MEASUREMENTS: Original expert clinician-confirmed codes were used for all model 
performance comparisons. F1 score was used as the primary model selection 
metric. Final classifier performance was evaluated using predictive accuracy. 
Clinician effort was measured in time to code, review, and confirm coded adverse 
events.
RESULTS: In a sample of 1000 adverse events, AI-based AE coding achieved higher 
accuracy (∼20% increase in accuracy) and was more cost-effective (∼80% cost 
reduction) than traditional clinician coding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results demonstrate how approaches that effectively 
combine AI and human expertise can improve the efficiency and quality of adverse 
event coding and clinical trial safety monitoring.

Alzheimer's disease is a complicated, multifaceted, neurodegenerative illness 
that places an increasing strain on healthcare systems. Due to increasing 
malfunction and death of nerve cells, the person suffering from Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) slowly and steadily loses their memories, cognitive functions and 
even their personality. Although medications may temporarily enhance memory, 
there are currently no permanent therapies that can halt or cure this 
irreversible neurodegenerative process. Nonetheless, fast progress in 
comprehending the cellular and molecular abnormalities responsible for neuronal 
degeneration has increased confidence in the development of viable prevention 
and treatments. All FDA-approved anti-AD medications have merely symptomatic 
effects and cannot cure the illness. This necessitates the pursuit of alternate 
treatments. Accumulating data shows that systemic neuroinflammation, oxidative 
stress and associated mitochondrial dysfunction play crucial roles in the 
etiology of AD and precede its clinical presentation. Therefore, innovative 
therapeutic approaches targeting these pathophysiological components of 
Alzheimer's disease are being explored aggressively in the present scenario. 
Phytochemicals such as resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, genistein and catechins 
are prospective therapies owing to their capacity to alter key AD pathogenetic 
pathways, such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial 
dysfunction. The use of new phytochemical delivery strategies would certainly 
provide the possibility to solve several issues with standard anti-AD medicines. 
In this review, the roles of phytophenolic compound-based treatment strategies 
for AD are discussed.

A 24-30 Centiloid (CL) threshold was collectively considered by a group of 
global dementia experts as a practical and implementable cut-off for 
anti-amyloid therapy intervention, in Alzheimer's disease patients who have been 
diagnosed at the mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of their 
disease. Though additional validation is needed, knowledge of this threshold 
would be valuable to those involved in diagnosing and treating patients in the 
new AD care pathways, as well as entry into clinical trials. Therapy monitoring 
to determine future treatment response and assess amyloid clearance can be 
accomplished with amyloid PET with some technical details still to be 
elucidated.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by the accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) of tau protein in the brain. Microglia, key immune cells of the 
central nervous system, play an important role in AD development and 
progression, primarily through their responses to Aβ and NFTs. Initially, 
microglia can clear Aβ, but in AD, chronic activation overwhelms protective 
mechanisms, leading to sustained neuroinflammation that enhances plaque 
toxicity, setting off a damaging cycle that affects neurons, astrocytes, 
cerebral vasculature, and other microglia. Current AD treatments have been 
largely ineffective, though emerging immunotherapies focusing on plaque removal 
show promise, but often overlook the role of neuroinflammation. Activated 
microglia display a complex range of phenotypes that can be broadly broken into 
pro- or anti-inflammatory states, although this dichotomy does not describe the 
significant overlap between states. Aβ can strongly induce inflammatory 
activity, triggering the production of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory 
cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), synapse engulfment, blood-brain barrier 
compromise, and impaired Aβ clearance. These processes contribute to neural 
tissue loss, manifesting as cognitive decline such as impaired executive 
function and memory. Conversely, anti-inflammatory activation exerts 
neuroprotective effects by suppressing inflammatory pathways and releasing 
neurotrophic factors that aid neuron repair and protection. Induction of 
anti-inflammatory states may offer a dual therapeutic approach to address both 
neuroinflammation and plaque accumulation in AD. This approach suggests 
potential strategies to modulate microglial phenotypes, aiming to restore 
neuroprotective functions and mitigate disease progression by simultaneously 
targeting inflammation and plaque pathology.

BACKGROUND: A brain healthy lifestyle, consisting of good cardiometabolic health 
and being cognitively and socially active in midlife, is associated with a lower 
risk of cognitive decline years later. However, it is unclear whether lifestyle 
changes over time also affect the risk for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI)/dementia, and rate of cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate if lifestyle changes over time are associated with 
incident MCI/dementia risk and rate of cognitive decline.
DESIGN: Population-based prospective cohort study SETTING: Personality and Total 
Health (PATH) Through Life Study cohort (Australia).
PARTICIPANTS: 4,777 participants (50.4% women), recruited between 2000 and 2002, 
who were 40-44 and 60-64 years old at baseline, without a prevalent dementia 
diagnosis. Participants had to have cognitive outcome measures available after 
baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Various measurements (neurocognitive assessment, blood pressure) 
and survey responses (demographics, cognitive, social, and physical activity, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, body height and weight, depression, and previous 
diagnoses) were collected approximately every four years. A brain-healthy 
lifestyle was operationalized via two well-validated modifiable dementia risk 
scores, the LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA) score and the modifiable part of 
the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRImod). 
Their change over time was estimated using latent growth curve modelling, and 
their association with cognition and incidence of MCI/dementia was investigated 
using parallel process modelling and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Within those aged 60-64 years at baseline (n=2,409), 211 cases of 
incident MCI/dementia were recorded over a median follow-up time of 12.2 years. 
On average, individuals' LIBRA and ANU-ADRImod increased (i.e., worsened) over 
time, but individuals whose scores increased one standard deviation (SD) less 
had a 19.0-24.6% lower risk for MCI/dementia (hazard ratio (95% confidence 
interval): LIBRAchange over time=0.754 (0.664-0.857), ANU-ADRImod, change over 
time=0.810 (0.71-0.915)), while controlling for the risk score at baseline and 
multiple potential confounders. Various associations between dementia risk score 
trajectories and cognitive performance trajectories were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to maintain a brain healthy lifestyle could reduce the risk 
for MCI or dementia, and slow cognitive decline.

INTRODUCTION: Informal care estimates for use in health-economic models are 
lacking. We aimed to estimate the association between informal care time and 
dementia symptoms across Europe.
METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed on 13,529 observations in 5,369 
persons from 9 European pooled cohort or trial studies in community-dwelling 
persons with dementia. A mixed regression model was fitted to time spent on 
instrumental or basic activities of daily living using disease severity and 
demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: Daily informal care time was 0.5 hours higher in moderate compared to 
mild and 1.3h higher in severe compared to mild cognitive impairment. Likewise, 
this was 1.2h and 2.7h for functional disability and 0.3h and 0.6h for 
behavioral symptoms in the same directions.
DISCUSSION: Estimates can be used in both single- and multi-domain 
health-economic models for dementia in European settings.

BACKGROUND: Soluble species of multimeric amyloid-beta including globular 
amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs) and linear amyloid-beta protofibrils are toxic to 
neurons. Sabirnetug (ACU193) is a humanized monoclonal antibody, raised against 
globular species of soluble AβO, that has over 650-fold greater binding affinity 
for AβOs over monomers and appears to have relatively little binding to amyloid 
plaque.
OBJECTIVES: To assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory measures 
including target engagement, biomarker effects, and clinical efficacy of 
sabirnetug in participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD; 
defined as mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to AD).
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose 
first-in-human phase 1 study.
SETTING: Fifteen study centers in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five participants with early symptomatic AD.
INTERVENTION: Participants received one infusion of sabirnetug 2 mg/kg, 10 
mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, or placebo (Part A) or three infusions of sabirnetug 
10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, or placebo (Part B).
MEASUREMENTS: Safety, tolerability, serum pharmacokinetics, and central target 
engagement of single and multiple doses of sabirnetug, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
concentrations of sabirnetug, and amyloid plaque load, as determined by positron 
emission tomography.
RESULTS: Sabirnetug was generally well tolerated. A larger percentage of 
participants receiving sabirnetug (56.3%) versus placebo (42.9%) had at least 
one treatment emergent adverse event, with approximately 29% in each group 
considered related to study drug. Most events were mild-to-moderate in severity. 
Of 48 participants given sabirnetug, five developed amyloid related imaging 
abnormalities - edema/effusion, including one instance that was mildly 
symptomatic in a participant who had received one dose sabirnetug 60 mg/kg. 
Notably, none of the six apolipoprotein E Ɛ4 homozygotes who received sabirnetug 
developed amyloid related imaging abnormalities - edema/effusion or - 
hemorrhage/hemosiderin deposition. Infusion reactions, such as rash, pain, or 
erythema, were not frequent (6.3% for sabirnetug versus 0.0% for placebo). 
Sabirnetug exposure was dose proportional in both serum and CSF. Target 
engagement, defined as drug bound to AβOs in CSF, was shown to be dose and 
exposure dependent. Over three months, approximately 25% and 20% reduction in 
amyloid plaques, respectively, were observed in participants receiving three 
infusions of sabirnetug 60 mg/kg every four weeks and 25 mg/kg every two weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: The Phase 1 INTERCEPT-AD study provided safety, tolerability, 
dosing, and target engagement data that supported the design of the ongoing 
ALTITUDE-AD study (NCT06335173).

There is growing consensus in the Alzheimer's community that combination therapy 
will be needed to maximize therapeutic benefits through the course of the 
disease. However, combination therapy raises complex questions and decisions for 
study sponsors, from preclinical research through clinical trial design to 
regulatory, statistical, and operational considerations. In January 2024, the 
Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation convened an expert advisory board to 
discuss the key considerations in each of these areas. Experts agreed on the 
need to prioritize a combination therapy approach that encompasses a wide range 
of targets associated with aging and the underlying biology of Alzheimer's 
disease. Progress in combination therapy could be accelerated by leveraging 
preclinical research and Phase 1 and 2A trials to identify the most promising 
combinations for further development, exploring repurposed agents with available 
preclinical and clinical data, building collaborations across sectors to support 
operational challenges, and planning for the likely impact of anti-amyloid 
beta-protein monoclonal antibody therapies on future clinical trial designs.

BACKGROUND: There are no approved oral disease-modifying treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of 
blarcamesine (ANAVEX®2-73), an orally available small-molecule activator of the 
sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) in early AD through restoration of cellular 
homeostasis including autophagy enhancement.
DESIGN: ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
48-week Phase IIb/III trial.
SETTING: Multicenter - 52 medical research centers/hospitals in 5 countries.
INTERVENTION: 508 participants with early AD (Stage 3) were randomized to 
receive either blarcamesine (n = 338) in medium dose group 30 mg or in high dose 
group 50 mg or placebo (n = 170) oral capsules once daily for 48 weeks. 
Participants in these groups were offered to enroll into the 
open-label-extension study ATTENTION-AD, which completed June 2024, 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04314934.
MEASUREMENTS: The co-primary cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed as 
change in ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-ADL from baseline to 48 weeks. The outcomes 
include the secondary outcome CDR-SB and biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, 
plasma Aβ42/40-ratio and global brain volume changes measured by MRI. All 
clinical endpoints were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), 
plasma biomarker measurements were analyzed by Welch's t-test, and volumetric 
MRI scans were analyzed by general linear model.
RESULTS: Among 462 randomized participants in the intent-to-treat population 
(mean age, 73.7 years; 225 [48.7%] women), 338 (73.2%) completed the trial. The 
co-primary outcome was met under the multiplicity control rule, since the 
differences in the least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to 48 weeks 
between the prespecified blarcamesine and placebo groups for ADAS-Cog13 was 
significant at a level of P < 0.025 and for CDR-SB was significant at a level of 
P < 0.025, while ADCS-ADL did not reach significance at Week 48 (ADAS-Cog13 
difference of -2.027 [95% CI -3.522 to -0.533]; P = 0.008; CDR-SB difference of 
-0.483 [95% CI -0.853 to -0.114]; P = 0.010; ADCS-ADL difference of 0.775 [95%CI 
-0.874 to 2.423]; P = 0.357). Plasma Aβ42/40-ratio increased significantly with 
blarcamesine group vs. placebo, (P = 0.048) and whole brain volume loss was 
significantly decreased (P = 0.002). Participants in the full safety population 
with ≥1 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 56 
participants (16.7%) in the blarcamesine and 17 (10.1%) in the placebo group. 
Common TEAEs included dizziness, which was transient and mostly mild to moderate 
in severity. One death in the blarcamesine group and 1 in the placebo group were 
both not considered treatment related.
CONCLUSIONS: Blarcamesine, demonstrating a safety profile with no associated 
neuroimaging adverse events, significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% 
at 48 weeks with blarcamesine group as well as the individual 30 mg (by 34.6%) 
and 50 mg (by 38.5%) blarcamesine groups vs. placebo on the prespecified primary 
cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. The prespecified secondary endpoint CDR-SB, which 
is used as the sole primary endpoint in recent successful AD drug submissions, 
is significantly improved at Week 48 with blarcamesine relative to placebo. The 
findings are supported by biomarkers from the A/T/N spectrum, including plasma 
Aβ42/40-ratio and reduction of whole brain atrophy. Additionally, the 
prespecified SIGMAR1 gene variant subgroup analysis confirmed beneficial 
clinical effect of blarcamesine group through upstream SIGMAR1 activation - 
subjects with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the 
mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant) experienced an even greater significant 
clinical benefit with slowed clinical progression by 49.8% at 48 weeks on the 
prespecified primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. Oral once daily blarcamesine 
could represent a novel treatment in early AD and be complementary or 
alternative to anti-beta amyloid drugs.

OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have examined the effects of physical activity on 
cognitive performance and executive function in people with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), although the findings are not entirely consistent. There are also 
insufficient study reviews for specific workout and assessment tool types. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the 
effects of aerobic exercise on the quality of life, cognitive performance and 
depressive symptoms in people with AD.
DESIGN: Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses using random-effects modelling, and 
certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation tool.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL 
and CNKI through 12 March 2024.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The analysis includes all randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) that used aerobic exercise as an intervention for individuals with AD.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two writers selected and searched for data using 
defined techniques. To investigate possible sources of heterogeneity between 
studies, meta-regression was carried out using Stata MP V.18.0 and V.14.0 
software, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs were computed, and 
data were reviewed using Review Manager V.5.4 software, which was made available 
by the Cochrane Collaboration. Sensitivity analyses were employed to ascertain 
the stability and reliability of the results, and funnel plots and Egger's test 
were employed to check for publication bias. Correction and assessment of 
publication bias was done using Duval and Tweedie clipping methods.
RESULTS: Aerobic exercise enhanced cognitive function. For the Minimum Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) (SMD=0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32, Z=5.06, p<0.00001), 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Section (ADAS-cog) (SMD=-0.67, 
95% CI -1.15 to -0.2, Z=2.77, p=0.006) and quality of life (SMD=0.36, 95% CI 
0.08 to 0.64, Z=2.51, p=0.01), but not statistically significant for depressive 
symptoms (SMD=-0.25, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.13, Z=1.27, p=0.21). Subgroup analysis 
showed that duration greater than 16 weeks and less than 50 min per intervention 
improved MMSE Scores. Duration greater than 16 weeks and more than 30 min per 
intervention improved ADAS-cog Scores in patients with AD. Aerobic exercise 
greater than 16 weeks, with more than three interventions per week and 30-50 min 
per intervention improves quality of life in patients with AD.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that aerobic exercise was conducive to the 
improvement of cognitive function and quality of life among patients with AD, 
yet it did not exert a significant impact on the amelioration of depressive 
symptoms. Nevertheless, given the high level of heterogeneity and the variations 
in the quality of the included studies, the conclusions require further 
verification through more scientifically objective RCTs.

Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota (GM) plays a crucial role in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and progression. This narrative review 
explores the complex interplay between GM, the immune system, and the central 
nervous system in AD. We discuss mechanisms through which GM dysbiosis can 
compromise intestinal barrier integrity, enabling pro-inflammatory molecules and 
metabolites to enter systemic circulation and the brain, potentially 
contributing to AD hallmarks. Additionally, we examine other pathophysiological 
mechanisms by which GM may influence AD risk, including the production of 
short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites. The 
role of the vagus nerve in gut-brain communication is also addressed. We 
highlight potential therapeutic implications of targeting GM in AD, focusing on 
antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, phytochemicals, and fecal 
microbiota transplantation. While preclinical studies showed promise, clinical 
evidence remains limited and inconsistent. We critically assess clinical trials, 
emphasizing challenges in translating GM-based therapies to AD patients. The 
reviewed evidence underscores the need for further research to elucidate precise 
molecular mechanisms linking GM to AD and determine whether GM dysbiosis is a 
contributing factor or consequence of AD pathology. Future studies should focus 
on large-scale clinical trials to validate GM-based interventions' efficacy and 
safety in AD.

The aging population has led to a significant increase in neurodegenerative 
diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), which adversely affects the 
quality of life and longevity of the elderly. Abnormal plasmalogen metabolism 
plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. This study focused on tmem189, a 
key gene involved in plasmalogen synthesis. We successfully cloned and 
characterized the open reading frame (ORF) of tmem189 in Takifugu rubripes, 
revealing that it encodes a protein consisting of 275 amino acids. Notably, 
tmem189 expression was found to be higher in brain compared to other tissues. We 
transfected a GFP-tagged eukaryotic expression vector into 293 T cells, 
confirming successful expression of tmem189 with increased expression  levels. 
Additionally, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis 
demonstrated that tmem189 promotes plasmalogen synthesis in the transfected 293T 
cells. Our findings suggest that tmem189 could serve as a potential target for 
the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, providing new insights into the 
promotion of plasmalogen synthesis.

Multi-targeted drug therapy has received substantial attention for the treatment 
of diseases of multi-factorial origin, including neurodegenerative and 
autoimmune diseases. It seems reasonable to argue that the complex pathology of 
neurodegenerative diseases (ND) cannot be reduced to a single target to modulate 
a broad range of cellular signaling, associated pathologies, and symptoms. It is 
this idea that has brought the attention of the scientific world towards 
phytochemicals and traditional drugs that are notoriously multi-targeted. A 
systematic study of these formulations and establishing the molecular pathways 
of individual molecules can lead to a standardized multi-component product that 
can modulate a broad range of activities on different targets of ND. This could 
provide an accessible and affordable solution to the significant disease burden 
of ND. With this idea in mind, a systematic review was carried out on an 
Ayurvedic product Manasamitra Vatakam (MMV), known to be a neuroprotective 
formulation and highly effective against Alzheimer's disease. MMV can be a 
source of phytomolecules for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The 
multifactorial nature of these diseases makes them suitable candidates for 
testing phytochemicals due to the inherent multitargeting capabilities of these 
compounds. The primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the phytomolecules from MMV that are responsible for its 
multitargeted effect against neurodegenerative diseases. From the reported 
literature, it is clear that many phytoconstituents and extracts of the herbal 
ingredients from MMV have demonstrated their efficacy against AD models. 
However, the combination of these molecules in AD models has never been tested. 
Scientific studies should be done to explore the bioactive compounds in the 
formulation and the druggability of these identified compounds can be evaluated 
using experimental methods.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment occurs frequently in persons with multiple 
sclerosis (PwMS) at some point in the course of the disease. However, not all 
PwMS develop cognitive difficulties suggesting a role for important moderating 
factors. We examined baseline predictors of cross-sectional and longitudinal 
change in cognitive performance in PwMS.
METHODS: 680 PwMS enrolled in the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of 
Multiple Sclerosis at the Brigham and Women's Hospital who completed the Symbol 
Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), a brief measure of speed of information 
processing, at least twice during a 10-year period were identified. Potential 
baseline demographic (age, education, and sex), clinical (disability, disease 
duration, and disease category), and patient-reported outcome (PRO) (fatigue, 
depression, and quality of life) predictors were examined in cross-sectional 
analyses using linear regression and in longitudinal analyses using linear mixed 
effects models.
RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses, age, disease duration, and disability each 
showed associations with SDMT. Group differences were observed between females 
and males, subjects with and without college degrees, and subjects with 
relapsing and progressive MS. All PRO measures showed associations with SDMT, 
and the strongest association was with fatigue. In the longitudinal model, 
increased baseline age and increased baseline disability were each associated 
with a greater decline in SDMT performance. None of the baseline PROs were 
associated with longitudinal change in SDMT.
CONCLUSION: We observed strong associations between baseline demographic, 
clinical, and PRO measures and concurrent SDMT, but more limited associations 
between these measures and longitudinal change in SDMT.

Pyrimidines are aromatic, heterocyclic organic compounds characterized by a 
six-membered ring that contains four carbon atoms and two nitrogen atoms. They 
have been reported to exhibit a variety of biological activities such as 
antifungal, antiviral, and anti-Parkinsonian effects. Recently, there has been 
an increased focus on their potential anti-Alzheimer's properties. Several 
pyrimidine-based drugs and their analogs are currently undergoing various phases 
of clinical trials, indicating pyrimidine as a promising chemical structure for 
drug development. Notably, modifications to the pyrimidine structure 
significantly influence their activity against Alzheimer's disease. For 
instance, the introduction of heteroatoms into the pyrimidine ring or 
alternations in the length of the linkage region have been shown to enhance 
therapeutic efficacy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of 
pyrimidine derivatives as potential therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, with a 
focus on structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, design strategies, and 
binding mechanisms. These insights could pave the way for the development of 
more effective anti-Alzheimer's medications.

Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress, Apoptosis, and Redox Signaling: Key Players in 
Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases are significant health concerns that have a profound 
impact on the quality and duration of life for millions of individuals. These 
diseases are characterized by pathological changes in various brain regions, 
specific genetic mutations associated with the disease, deposits of abnormal 
proteins, and the degeneration of neurological cells. As neurodegenerative 
disorders vary in their epidemiological characteristics and vulnerability of 
neurons, treatment of these diseases is usually aimed at slowing disease 
progression. The heterogeneity of genetic and environmental factors involved in 
the process of neurodegeneration makes current treatment methods inadequate. 
However, the existence of common molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of 
these diseases may allow the development of new targeted therapeutic strategies. 
Oxidative and nitrosative stress damages membrane components by accumulating ROS 
and RNS and disrupting redox balance. This process results in the induction of 
apoptosis, which is important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases 
through oxidative stress. Studies conducted using postmortem human samples, 
animal models, and cell cultures have demonstrated that oxidative stress, 
nitrosative stress, and apoptosis are crucial factors in the development of 
diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. The excessive production of 
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, elevated levels of free radicals, 
heightened mitochondrial stress, disturbances in energy metabolism, and the 
oxidation and nitrosylation of cellular macromolecules are recognized as 
triggers for neuronal cell death. Challenges in managing and treating 
neurodegenerative diseases require a better understanding of this field at the 
molecular level. Therefore, this review elaborates on the molecular mechanisms 
by which oxidative and nitrosative stress are involved in neuronal apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by impaired inhibitory 
circuitry and GABAergic dysfunction, which is associated with reduced fast brain 
oscillations in the gamma band (γ, 30-90 Hz) in several animal models. 
Investigating such activity in human patients could lead to the identification 
of novel biomarkers of diagnostic and prognostic value. The current study aimed 
to test a multimodal "Perturbation-based" transcranial Alternating Current 
Stimulation-Electroencephalography (tACS)-EEG protocol to detect how responses 
to tACS in AD patients correlate with patients' clinical phenotype.
METHODS: Fourteen participants with mild to moderate dementia due to AD 
underwent a baseline assessment including cognitive status, peripheral 
neuroinflammation, and resting-state (rs)EEG. The tACS-EEG recordings included 
brief (6') tACS blocks of gamma (i.e., 40 Hz) stimulation administered through 4 
different montages, with Pre/Post 32-Channels EEG for each block. Changes in 
tACS-EEG and rsEEG γ band power with respect to baseline were adopted as a 
metric of induction and compared with cognitive scores and neuroinflammatory 
biomarkers.
RESULTS: We found positive correlations between 40 Hz-induced γ activity in 
fronto-central-parietal areas and patient cognitive status and negative ones 
with neuroinflammatory markers. Participants with greater cognitive impairment 
exhibited less γ induction and higher peripheral neuroinflammation. The same 
analysis performed with spectral power from baseline rsEEG resulted in no 
significant correlations, promoting the value of tACS-based perturbation for 
capturing individual differences in pathology-related brain features.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests a link between tACS-induced γ band spectral power 
and clinical severity, with weaker γ induction corresponding to more severe 
clinical/cognitive impairment. This study provides preliminary support for the 
development of novel physiological biomarkers and therapeutic targets based on 
disease severity.

The purpose of this article is to infer patient level outcomes from population 
level randomized control trials (RCTs). In this pursuit, we utilize the recently 
proposed synthetic nearest neighbors (SNN) estimator. At its core, SNN leverages 
information across patients to impute missing data associated with each patient 
of interest. We focus on two types of missing data: (i) unrecorded outcomes from 
discontinuing the assigned treatments and (ii) unobserved outcomes associated 
with unassigned treatments. Data imputation in the former powers and de-biases 
RCTs, while data imputation in the latter simulates "synthetic RCTs" to predict 
the outcomes for each patient under every treatment. The SNN estimator is 
interpretable, transparent, and causally justified under a broad class of 
missing data scenarios. Relative to several standard methods, we empirically 
find that SNN performs well for the above two applications using Phase 3 
clinical trial data on patients with Alzheimer's Disease. Our findings directly 
suggest that SNN can tackle a current pain point within the clinical trial 
workflow on patient dropouts and serve as a new tool towards the development of 
precision medicine. Building on our insights, we discuss how SNN can further 
generalize to real-world applications.

Statins are first-line treatments in the primary and secondary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease. Clinical studies show statins act independently of 
lipid-lowering mechanisms to decrease C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation 
marker. We aim to elucidate genetic loci associated with CRP statin response. 
CRP statin response is the change in log-CRP between off-treatment and 
on-treatment measurements. Cohort-level Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) 
of CRP response were performed using 1000 Genomes imputed data, testing ∼10 
million common genetic variants. GWAS meta-analysis combined results from seven 
cohorts and clinical trials totalling 14,070 statin-treated individuals of 
European ancestry within the GIST consortium. Secondary analyses included 
statin-by-placebo interaction analyses, and lookups in African ancestry cohorts. 
Our GWAS identified two genome-wide significant (P < 5e-8) loci: APOE and HNF1A 
for CRP statin response corrected for baseline CRP. The missense lead variant 
rs429358 at APOE, contributing to the APOE-E4 haplotype, is a risk locus for 
dyslipidaemia, Alzheimer's and coronary artery disease (CAD). The HNF1A locus is 
associated with diabetes, cholesterol levels, and CAD. Both loci are also 
associated with baseline CRP levels, and neither locus achieved a significant 
(P < 0.05) result from the statin v. placebo interaction meta-analysis using 
randomized clinical trial data. However, the interaction result (P-int=0.09) for 
APOE was suggestive and possibly underpowered. The APOE-E4 signal may therefore 
be associated with both CRP and LDL-cholesterol statin response. Combined with 
suggestions in the literature that APOE also leads to differential statin 
benefit in Alzheimer's, the APOE locus warrants further investigation for 
potential genetic effects on healthcare with statin treatment.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of diseases that pose a serious threat to 
human health, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
Huntington's disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In recent 
years, it has been found that mitochondrial remodeling plays an important role 
in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial 
remodeling refers to the dynamic regulatory process of mitochondrial morphology, 
number and function, which can affect neuronal cell function and survival by 
regulating mechanisms such as mitochondrial fusion, division, clearance and 
biosynthesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important intrinsic cause of the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial remodeling 
abnormalities are involved in energy metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases. 
Pathological changes in mitochondrial function and morphology, as well as 
interactions with other organelles, can affect the energy metabolism of 
dopaminergic neurons and participate in the development of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Since the number of patients with PD and AD has been increasing year 
by year in recent years, it is extremely important to take effective 
interventions to significantly reduce the number of morbidities and to improve 
people's quality of life. More and more researchers have suggested that 
mitochondrial remodeling and related dynamics may positively affect 
neurodegenerative diseases in terms of neuronal and self-adaptation to the 
surrounding environment. Mitochondrial remodeling mainly involves its own 
fission and fusion, energy metabolism, changes in channels, mitophagy, and 
interactions with other cellular organelles. This review will provide a 
systematic summary of the role of mitochondrial remodeling in neurodegenerative 
diseases, with the aim of providing new ideas and strategies for further 
research on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AIM: Standardized evaluation of [18F]PI-2620 tau-PET scans in 4R-tauopathies 
represents an unmet need in clinical practice. This study aims to investigate 
the effectiveness of visual evaluation of [18F]PI-2620 images for diagnosing 
4R-tauopathies and to develop a straight-forward reading algorithm to improve 
objectivity and data reproducibility.
METHODS: A total of 83 individuals with [18F]PI-2620 PET scans were included. 
Participants were classified as probable 4R-tauopathies (n = 29), Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) (n = 20), α-synucleinopathies (n = 15), and healthy controls (n = 
19) based on clinical criteria. Visual assessment of tau-PET scans (choice: 
4R-tauopathy, AD-tauopathy, no-tauopathy) was conducted using either 
20-40-minute or 40-60-minute intervals, with raw (common) and cerebellar grey 
matter scaled standardized reading settings (intensity-scaled). Two readers 
evaluated scans independently and blinded, with a third reader providing 
consensus in case of discrepant primary evaluation. A regional analysis was 
performed using the cortex, basal ganglia, midbrain, and dentate nucleus. 
Sensitivity, specificity, and interrater agreement were calculated for all 
settings and compared against the visual reads of parametric images 
(0-60-minutes, distribution volume ratios, DVR).
RESULTS: Patients with 4R-tauopathies in contrast to non-4R-tauopathies were 
detected at higher sensitivity in the 20-40-minute frame (common: 79%, scaled: 
76%) compared to the 40-60-minute frame (common: 55%, scaled: 62%), albeit with 
reduced specificity in the common setting (20-40-min: 78%, 40-60-min: 95%), 
which was ameliorated in the intensity-scaled setting (20-40-min: 91%, 
40-60-min: 96%). Combined assessment of multiple brain regions did not 
significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity, compared to assessing the basal 
ganglia alone (76% each). Evaluation of intensity-scaled parametric images 
resulted in higher sensitivity compared to intensity-scaled static scans (86% 
vs. 76%) at similar specificity (89% vs. 91%).
CONCLUSION: Visual reading of [18F]PI-2620 tau-PET scans demonstrated reliable 
detection of 4R-tauopathies, particularly when standardized processing methods 
and early imaging windows were employed. Parametric images should be preferred 
for visual assessment of 4R-tauopathies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which 
there is slow and gradual impairment of mental function. Considering the 
increase in cases due to population aging, the potential benefits of physical 
training in AD are of great importance and need further elucidation. This study 
aims to identify the impact of physical training on crucial aspects of AD such 
as cognitive status, physical performances, quality of life and activities of 
daily living. The bibliographic research was conducted according to the 
guidelines outlined in PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analysis). After the selection process, 26 studies were included in the 
systematic review and meta-analysis. Physical training for up to 12 weeks had a 
moderate effect on the cognitive status (SMD: 0.34; 95 % CI: 0.07-0.61; 
p = 0.016), the physical performance (SMD: 0.75; 95 % CI: 0.43-1.06; p = 0.000) 
and the quality of life (SMD: 0.40; 95 % CI: 0.17-0.63; p = 0.567) of patients 
with AD, but did not affect their daily living activities (SMD: -0.10; 95 % CI: 
-0.31-0.12; p = 0.621). Physical training lasting from 16 to 24 weeks had a 
moderate effect only on the physical performance (SMD: 0.51; 95 % CI: 0.23-0.79; 
p = 0.000) of patients. Physical training for up to 12 weeks already leads to 
gains on the cognition, the physical performance and the quality of life of 
individuals with AD. Beyond the available evidence on health promotion resulting 
from physical training, guidelines should be established to define ideal 
training loads for patients with AD. Specific practical recommendations 
concerning the types, frequency, intensity or duration of physical exercise that 
may be the most efficient for ameliorating cognition, physical performance and 
quality of life of individuals with AD are still unclear.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (S. 
chinensis), first recorded in Shennong's Classic of the Materia Medica, is 
described as a "top grade medicine". As a traditional Chinese medicine of 
tonifying the kidneys and the brain, S. chinensis is widely used to treat 
diseases such as amnesia and dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a 
neurodegenerative disease, and ferroptosis is one of the essential causes of AD. 
Although previous studies have suggested that the lignans of S. chinensis (SCL) 
have neuroprotective effects, it is unclear whether SCL can alleviate AD 
pathology by inhibiting ferroptosis.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect of SCL on AD caused by ferroptosis 
and its possible molecular mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was based on SAMR1/SAMP8 mouse models along 
with Erastin-induced HT22 cell lines to examine the influence of SCL on 
ferroptosis in AD. The S. chinensis was extracted via 75% EtOH-H2O and 
identified by HPLC/UPLC-QTOF-MS. MWM assessed spatial learning, while HE 
staining, biochemical detection, IHC, and WB analyzed AD pathology and iron 
metabolism. Mitochondrial changes were evaluated by TEM, and confocal imaging 
post-SCL treatment analyzed ROS, MMP, and Fe2+ levels in HT22 cells. IF 
determined the expression levels and localization of Nrf2 and FPN1. CETSA was 
deployed to study the interaction between SCL and Nrf2.
RESULTS: Treatment with SCL mitigated cognitive dysfunction and reduced p-Tau as 
well as neuronal loss in AD model mice. Additionally, the administration of SCL 
alleviated oxidative stress and maintained relatively intact mitochondrial 
ridges and membranes, decreased TFR and DMT1 protein expression, and upregulated 
FTH1. Consistent with the in vivo results, SCL inhibited Erastin-induced 
ferroptosis in HT22 cells. SCL promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and 
upregulated FPN1, SLC7A11, and GPX4 protein expressions while decreasing FACL4. 
The improvement of ferroptosis by SCL was associated with the regulation of the 
Nrf2/FPN1 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: The novel discoveries of this study suggest that SCL can suppress 
ferroptosis in the brains of AD model mice and exerts a partial protective 
effect against Erastin-induced ferroptosis in HT22 cells, in which the Nrf2/FPN1 
signaling pathway plays a crucial role.

BCL11B is a Cys2-His2 zinc-finger (C2H2-ZnF) domain-containing, DNA-binding, 
transcription factor with established roles in the development of various organs 
and tissues, primarily the immune and nervous systems. BCL11B germline variants 
have been associated with a variety of developmental syndromes. However, 
genotype-phenotype correlations along with pathophysiologic mechanisms of 
selected variants mostly remain elusive. To dissect these, we performed 
genotype-phenotype correlations of 92 affected individuals harboring a 
pathogenic or likely pathogenic BCL11B variant, followed by immune phenotyping, 
analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing data, dual-luciferase 
reporter assays, and molecular modeling. These integrative analyses enabled us 
to define three clinical subtypes of BCL11B-related disorders. It is likely that 
gene-disruptive BCL11B variants and missense variants affecting zinc-binding 
cysteine and histidine residues cause mild to moderate neurodevelopmental delay 
with increased propensity for behavioral and dental anomalies, allergies and 
asthma, and reduced type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Missense variants within 
C2H2-ZnF DNA-contacting α helices cause highly variable clinical presentations 
ranging from multisystem anomalies with demise in the first years of life to 
late-onset, hyperkinetic movement disorder with poor fine motor skills. Those 
not in direct DNA contact cause a milder phenotype through reduced, 
target-specific transcriptional activity. However, missense variants affecting 
C2H2-ZnFs, DNA binding, and "specificity residues" impair BCL11B transcriptional 
activity in a target-specific, dominant-negative manner along with aberrant 
regulation of alternative DNA targets, resulting in more severe and 
unpredictable clinical outcomes. Taken together, we suggest that the phenotypic 
severity and variability is largely dependent on the DNA-binding affinity and 
specificity of altered BCL11B proteins.

4-N-substituted-2-phenylquinazoline derivatives was designed and synthesized as 
potential multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) through dual inhibition of AChE 
and MAO-B enzymes along with Aβ42 aggregation inhibition for the treatment of 
AD. Two compounds in the series, VAV-8 and VAV-19 were found to be the most 
potent inhibitors of both AChE and MAO-B enzymes and moderate inhibitor of Aβ42, 
with good thermodynamic stability at the binding pocket of the enzymes. Both the 
ligands showed moderate ROS inhibition and neuroprotection potential and found 
to be permeable to the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, VAV-8 was subjected to 
toxicity evaluation and in vivo investigation using a zebrafish model. In adult 
zebrafish, VAV-8 (5 μM, and 10 μM) was found to be effective in reducing 
cognitive deterioration, neurodegeneration, and oxidative stress induced by 
scopolamine. Thus, these quinazoline derivatives have the potential to be 
developed as MTDLs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a potential lifestyle 
intervention for mitigating cognitive decline and enhancing brain health in 
individuals with mild to major neurocognitive disorders. Unlike preventive 
strategies, this review evaluates IF as a therapeutic approach, focusing on its 
effects on neuroplasticity, inflammation, and cognitive function.
METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using a comprehensive PubMed search 
with the terms "intermittent fasting AND neurocognition" and "intermittent 
fasting AND neuroplasticity". Studies published in English within the last ten 
years involving human and animal models were included. Exclusion criteria 
focused on studies primarily examining mood disorders or unrelated metabolic 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Preclinical evidence demonstrates that IF enhances hippocampal 
neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity through pathways involving BDNF and CREB. 
IF also reduces neuroinflammation, as shown in animal models of Alzheimer's 
disease, vascular cognitive impairment, and high-fat diet-induced cognitive 
impairment. Human studies, though limited, suggest that regular IF may improve 
cognitive function and reduce markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: Current findings highlight the therapeutic potential of IF for 
individuals with existing cognitive impairment. While preclinical studies 
provide robust evidence of neuroprotective mechanisms, human studies remain 
sparse and require standardization. Further clinical research is necessary to 
confirm long-term safety and efficacy and to refine IF protocols for broader 
clinical application.

The development of potent glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor has 
been increasingly recognized as the candidate treatment against the 
multifactorial pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study 
prepared various new pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives, evaluated the anti-AD 
activities and detected the security based on the structure-guided rational 
design. Our results indicated that many pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives had 
strong GSK-3β inhibitory activities, particularly compounds 41, 46 and 54, with 
the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.22, 0.26 and 0.24 nM, 
respectively, and each of them generally possessed GSK-3β selectivity over 24 
structurally similar kinases. In addition, further targeting studies at the 
cellular level revealed that compound 41 increased GSK-3β phosphorylation at 
Ser9 site dose-dependently for inhibiting GSK-3β activity, therefore inhibiting 
the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein by decreasing the p-tau-Ser396 
abundance. Moreover, 41 up-regulated β-catenin and neurogenesis-related markers 
(GAP43 and MAP-2), thereby promoting neurite outgrowth of neurons in SH-SY5Y 
cells. According to the in vitro cells assay, 41 showed the lower cytotoxicity 
to SH-SY5Y cells with a survival rate of over 70 % at the concentration of 
100 μM. In vivo efficacy and acute toxicity experiments showed that, 41 
effectively ameliorated the dyskinesia in AlCl3-induced zebrafish AD models and 
exhibited its low-toxicity nature in C57BL/6 mice. Overall, the 
pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivative 41 could serve as a promising GSK-3β inhibitor 
for treating AD.

An emerging biomarker of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is the time of 
exchange (Tex) of water from the blood to tissue, as measured by multi-echo 
arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. This new non-invasive sequence, already tested 
in mice, has recently been adapted to humans and optimized for clinical scanning 
time. In this study, we studied the normal variability of Tex over age and sex, 
which needs to be established as a reference for studying changes in 
neurological disease. We evaluated Tex, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial 
transit time (ATT) in 209 healthy adults between 26 and 87 years, over age and 
sex, using general linear models in gray matter, white matter, and regionally in 
cerebral lobes. After QC, 194 participants were included in the main analysis, 
and the results demonstrated that both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) 
BBB permeability was higher with higher age (Tex lower by 0.47 ms per year in GM 
[p < 0.05], and by 0.49 ms in WM, for females; no significant for males), with 
the largest Tex difference in the frontal lobes (0.64 ms decrease per year, 
p = 0.011, population average). CBF was lower with higher age in the GM (-0.71 
mL/min/100g per year, p < 0.001, for females; -0.31 mL/min/100g per year, 
p < 0.05, for males). When correcting Tex models for CBF and ATT, effect of age 
on Tex disappears in the GM, but not in the WM (β=-0.28, p = 0.08). The CBF 
findings of this study are in line with previous studies, demonstrating the 
validity of the new sequence. The BBB water permeability variation over age and 
sex described in this study provides a reference for future BBB research.

Age-related cognitive impairment and dementia pose a significant global health, 
social, and economic challenge. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) has historically 
been viewed as the leading cause of dementia, recent evidence reveals the 
considerable impact of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), which 
now accounts for nearly half of all dementia cases. The Mediterranean 
diet-characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, 
fish, and olive oil-has been widely recognized for its cardiovascular benefits 
and may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. To investigate 
the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive health, we 
conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science, and 
Google Scholar, focusing on studies published between 2000 and 2024. The studies 
included in the meta-nalysis examined the adherence to the Mediterranean diet 
and the incidence of dementia and AD. We applied a random-effects model to 
calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 
assessed heterogeneity through I-square statistics. Forest plots, funnel plots, 
and Z-score plots were used to visualize study outcomes. Of the 324 full-text 
records reviewed, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria. The combined HR for 
cognitive impairment among those adhering to the Mediterranean diet was 0.82 
(95% CI 0.75-0.89); for dementia, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95); and for 
AD, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-0.82), indicating substantial protective 
effects. Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies, though Z-score 
plots suggested sufficient sample sizes to support reliable conclusions for each 
condition. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirms that adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet is associated with an 11-30% reduction in the risk of 
age-related cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment, dementia, and 
AD. These findings underscore the Mediterranean diet's potential as a central 
element in neuroprotective public health strategies to mitigate the global 
impact of cognitive decline and dementia and to promote healthier cognitive 
aging.
